            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To his ever honoured Friend</hi> Dr. WALTER NEEDHAM <hi>at the</hi> Charterhouſe.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOw at length I return you ſome of thoſe Papers which you was pleaſed ſo kindly to commit to my truſt: <hi>viz.</hi> Six Sermons of your Brothers, I ſay not the beſt I could pick out, (for indeed all that he compoſed were ſingularly good and uſeful) but ſuch as either he choſe to preach in the moſt publick places, or elſe were more particularly deſired by ſome of his friends.</p>
            <p>Had he himſelf deſigned or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared theſe Diſcourſes for the Preſs,
<pb facs="tcp:42893:3"/>
they would have appeared much more accurate and exact, than now perhaps ſome paſſages in them may ſeem to be; nor durſt I venture to make any conſiderable alterations. However as they are, I doubt not but they will be highly acceptable to all ſerious and devout Readers, and I am ſure they are far above the contempt even of the Criticks, and Wits of the Age.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch great moment are the Subjects here treated of, ſo plain and familiar is the Stile, ſo weighty and ſound the Arguments, that there needs no other reaſon to be given of theſe Sermons being made publick, than that they are ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently fitted to do good. Unleſs you, Sir, give me leave to mention this one; that theſe Papers will be a laſting Evidence and teſtimony to your ſelf and others his dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb facs="tcp:42893:3"/>
of the incomparable worth, ſweet temper, and undiſſembled Piety of your Brother; ſince you may by them to your no little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction eaſily perceive, what a very conſiderable man he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have proved, what good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you had to love him as you did, and how amply your great care of his Education was recompenſed and fully anſwered by thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary improvements he made of himſelf in ſo ſhort a time, though under much indiſpoſition of body, and of late Years labouring under a tedious incurable Diſeaſe: I may well call it incurable, ſince it reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted even all your skill and pains, and in ſpight of all you your ſelf could do, at laſt prevailed againſt him, whoſe life above others you ſo paſſionately wiſhed and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42893:4"/>
But here I think my ſelf bound to add, that he will be apt to do great wrong to the memory of our Author, who ſhall make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Learning and Abilities onely by what he may find in this little Book. Preaching, perhaps, was his leaſt Talent; a Work he but lately entered upon, and by the By onely performed. You know, Sir, he obſerved a juſt and prudent Method in his Studies, and had laid in a great Stock of uſeful Knowledge of all kinds, deſigning all along not ſo much to fit himſelf for theſe Pulpit Exerciſes, as to be a General Scholar.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſuch he was, there being few parts of Learning in which he had not made a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable progreſs. On which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he became moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to <hi>Queens Colledge;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42893:4"/>
his known merits and prudence drawing many young Gentlemen and others under his care, to their own ſingular advantage, and the credit of that Royal Foundation.</p>
            <p>Nor was he onely admired in, or uſeful to his own particular Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ſo remarkable was his Worth and Goodneſs, that his Friendſhip and Acquaintance was deſired by many others. His Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gained him every where Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reſpect, and his good Nature and moſt obliging Carriage won him the love and favour of the whole Univerſity; ſo that he was the Man, of whom I never heard any one ſay an ill word.</p>
            <p>It is difficult for me here to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; ſo pleaſant is it to me to think of my Old Friend Mr. NEEDHAM. And I know I ſhall be ſufficiently blamed by his Acquaintance for
<pb facs="tcp:42893:5"/>
ſaying ſo little of ſuch an excellent perſon. One will tell me, that at leaſt his wonderful modeſty and perfect freedom from all manner of pride and conceit; another, that the briskneſs of his fanſie, and the pleaſantneſs of his humour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, whileſt he enjoyed any meaſure of health; a third, that his admirable Patience, and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency as to this World; others, that his faithful and truly friendly temper; that theſe with many other of his excellent Vertues ought to have been duly rehearſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated. Every one that knew him will find fault, that ſomething or other, for which he was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, is now omitted.</p>
            <p>It was the ſaying of a great <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> when he was asked why his Statue was not erected in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, as well as of many others
<pb facs="tcp:42893:5"/>
of far leſs note and deſert; that he had much rather people ſhould wonder and enquire why he had no Statue, than that any ſhould ask why he had one. I had much rather be cenſured for falling infinitely ſhort of what my Subject might juſtly challenge, than that any one ſhould upon this or any like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, accuſe me of Flattery or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</p>
            <p>After all I muſt confeſs, Sir, I have one private ſelfiſh deſign in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; which is, to take this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion moſt thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg your great undeſerved favours and kindneſſes to me, which I can put on no other account, but your own goodneſs, and that your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would pleaſe to call me his Friend.</p>

            <p>THe deſign of our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours coming into the World, as he himſelf declares at the 17. <hi>verſe</hi> of this Chapter, was <hi>not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil them.</hi> This he performed, partly by doing, and ſuffering all that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had foretold concerning him, and by accompliſhing what was fore-ſhewn
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42893:9"/>
by the Types and Shadows of the Law; partly by his divine Diſcourſes and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons giving new life and authority to thoſe Rules of Good Living they had been taught by <hi>Moſes;</hi> adding to, and improving them where they were defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and reſtoring them to their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe and purity, where they were either obſcurely delivered, or by the miſinterpretation of their Doctors were generally miſunderſtood: and this he did ſuitably to the different nature of thoſe Commands which they had received in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; ſome whereof conſiſted of Rites and Ceremonial Obſervances, which were a Shadow of things to come, and were upon the accompliſhment of thoſe things preſently to have an end: Others contained the neceſſary Rules of Good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and were of an abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature. Now ſo it came to paſs, that the Jews, a People infinitely prone to Superſtition, were very nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the obſervance of thoſe outward Circumſtances and Ceremonies of the Law, even to the neglect of the greater duties of Righteouſneſs, Judgment and Mercy, which they ought chiefly to have done, though not to have left the other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42893:9"/>
undone. The blame of this practice is by our Saviour frequently laid upon the Scribes and Phariſees, who then were the great pretenders to the Righteouſneſs of the Law, yet in truth the greateſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of it, by laying the chief ſtreſs upon the outward and leſs material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and evacuating the moral parts of it by too nice and narrow inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. Our Saviour therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declared that he came <hi>to fulfil the Law and the Prophets,</hi> in purſuance of that deſign at the 20. <hi>v.</hi> he forewarns his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of this practice and doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſees; <hi>I ſay unto you, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> And that they might not be ignorant in what particulars they ought to exceed what the Phariſees taught, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Sermon he gives them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances, wherein the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> partly by its own obſcurity, partly by their miſinterpretations was generally miſunderſtood. Among other parts of the Moral Law which were not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Jews, there was none to which they were greater ſtrangers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42893:10"/>

            <p>They had received <hi>Levit.</hi> xix. 18. this precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge nor bear any grudge againſt the children of thy people, but thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Now the Jews underſtanding the word <hi>Neighbour</hi> only of the children of their People, of men of their own Tribe and Country, of men that kept mutual corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and agreement with them, they took it for granted that as for other men who were ſtrangers and aliens to them, they were at full liberty to exerciſe what revenge they pleaſed, as appears by the Verſe before the Text, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and hate thine Enemy.</hi> But this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clauſe, <hi>and hate thine Enemy,</hi> was an additional interpretation, no where to be found in the Law; and was in truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true intent and meaning of the former precept of <hi>Loving our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> as appears by our Saviours explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy: but I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Having thus far ſhewn the Connexion

of theſe words with the foregoing, and with the deſign of the whole Chapter, I ſhall now conſider them by themſelves, and ſhall endeavour to ſet before you,</p>

               <item>1. The Nature and Extent of the Duty enjoined.</item>

            </list>
            <p>I begin with the Nature and Extent of this Duty, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Love</hi> is of a very large ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and in the language of holy Scripture is generally uſed to expreſs the whole duty of man. Thus our Saviour uſeth it in the Summary of Religion which he taught the Lawyer, telling him that the whole Law was compriſed in theſe two things, the love of God and of our Neighbour: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 37.</note> 
               <hi>God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, this is the firſt and great Commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf: on theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> By which uſe of the word it is plain, that the <hi>love of our Neighbour</hi> includes all the Duties and Offices which one man can owe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo it is here to be underſtood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42893:11"/>
when applied to <hi>Enemies,</hi> as appears by the connexion of theſe words with the former Verſe, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy; but I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies.</hi> Where it is plain, our Saviour altered not the comprehenſive ſignification of the word, only enlarged the object of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that whereas they had been before taught to confine their <hi>Love,</hi> that is, the ſeveral offices of Juſtice and Charity, onely to their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> that is, as they underſtood it, only to their Friends and Countrymen; they ſhould now extend the ſame offices to <hi>Enemies</hi> likewiſe as well as to them, not onely to Strangers and Aliens, but to thoſe alſo that profeſt hatred to them, and did them injury. This he preſcribes firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the name of <hi>Love, I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies;</hi> and then, left they ſhould make too narrow an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word, he further explains it by the moſt obliging inſtances can be given of it, and that in oppoſition to the contrary practice of their Enemies; <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42893:11"/>
But not to inſiſt upon this large ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word, I ſhall now onely take notice of thoſe offices which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly due to our <hi>Enemies</hi> as ſuch, over and above what can be due to the reſt of our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and thoſe are referred uſually to theſe three general Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That we do not return thoſe evils upon our Enemy which he hath done us.</item>
               <item>2. That we forgive him from our hearts.</item>
               <item>3. That we recompenſe good to him when he ſtands in need of our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. If we are commanded to <hi>love our Enemies,</hi> it is eaſie to underſtand that we are hereby forbidden all practices towards him that are inconſiſtent with Love and Charity, and therefore that we muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all acts of revenge and hoſtility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, all recompenſing evil for evil. This branch of our duty our Saviour par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly teaches at the 38, 39. verſes of this Chapter, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not evil, but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo.</hi> Where by the way we may obſerve, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42893:12"/>
our Saviour doth prevent the moſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Argument men are wont to uſe to juſtifie their revenge. <hi>Veterem ferendo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriam invitas novam,</hi> was always a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for it: and many men who would otherwiſe be thought good Chriſtians are ſtill apt to urge it as a ſufficient reaſon to return evil upon their adverſaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe they may by too much forbearance be encouraged to go on in the ſame practice of doing injuries and offering affronts. Now the caſe here mentioned by our Saviour, is very plain in oppoſition to that pretence, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo.</hi> The meaning of which words is, that in matters of leſs moment, as the inſtance there given is, the good Chriſtian ought rather expoſe himſelf to further injuries, than return the ſame uſage to his adverſary that he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from him, or be guilty of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful act. So patient muſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord be toward all men, <hi>not rendring evil for evil, nor railing for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This duty will, I know, ſeem very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to men of this generation, who are uſually ſo far from being ſatisfied with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42893:12"/>
an equal return of evil upon their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that their revenge ſeldom ends with leſs then the death or ruine of their brethren, and that often upon very ſlight or no provocation. It is indeed a ſad thing to conſider, that in a Chriſtian Commonwealth Point of Honour and Gallantry ſhould be ſo often pleaded as a juſt pretence for Bloudſhed and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a raſh word, or a contumelious expreſſion ſhould be thought a ſufficient provocation to engage life and ſoul too in purſuance of our revenge, and that in contradiction to ſo plain a precept, which by the profeſſion of Chriſtianity we ſtand obliged to. But how dangerous a choice theſe men make, I ſhall have occaſion to diſcourſe by and by. In the mean time we are to know that the forbearing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is but the firſt and loweſt degree of that Charity, which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires towards our Enemies, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt hereby the name of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not ſufficient that we abſtain from outward acts of Hoſtility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge towards our Enemies, but we muſt lay aſide all thoughts and deſires of it. We are not to wiſh the ſame evil to our Neighbour that he hath done to us, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42893:13"/>
are not to retain any angry or malicious thought, no grudge or animoſity, no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hate or envious deſign againſt the perſon of any man, how much ſoever he hath been our Enemy. We may have other reaſons that may oblige us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from outward acts of Revenge: ſometimes we may be too weak to do it, and want power or opportunity to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our deſigns of evil<hi>:</hi> ſometimes it may be againſt ſome other intereſt of ours which we prefer before it; and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Revenge onely in ſuch circumſtances is no part of our obedience to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Saviour, which extends it ſelf to the inward motions and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of our ſoul, and requires that our forgiveneſs be from the heart. And indeed the primary intention of all the divine Law, is to regulate the inward thoughts and habitual inclinations of the Soul, and to bring them into ſubjection and conformity to the will of God. Nor can we be ſaid to obey any one precept of the Goſpel onely by abſtaining from the viſible acts of ſin, unleſs we do likewiſe mortifie and ſubdue the ſecret luſts, and inordinate deſires of our heart, which are the inward principles and ſeeds of our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42893:13"/>
outward actions: according to which the good or evil of them will be meaſured. To be ſure the word <hi>Love</hi> is of all other moſt properly to be underſtood of the inward affections of the Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are obliged by this precept to lay aſide, and reſtrain all thoſe black paſſions which any ways prompt us to ſeek revenge, or rejoice in the hurt that befalls our Neighbour. To this purpoſe is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 31. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> Nay, the Scripture is ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this caſe, that though we ſhould forbear to return evil upon our brother that hath offended us, though our hand be not upon him to kill him, or do him hurt; yet if we nouriſh in our boſom any angry and malicious thought againſt him, if we wiſh harm to him, or rejoice over thoſe evils that befall him, this would be as direct a breach of the Law of forgiveneſs, as though we our ſelves had been the executioners of our Revenge upon him. So S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42893:14"/>
iii. 15. <hi>Whoſoever hateth his brother is a murderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is yet a further degree of Charity towards our Enemies. We muſt not onely forbear the return of evil, we muſt not onely forgive them heartily and wiſh them no evil, but we are obliged alſo to exerciſe acts of mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, we muſt be ready to do them good whenſoever they may need it from us. <hi>If thine Enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt give him drink.</hi> But poſſibly he needs no ſuch aſſiſtance, poſſibly his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is ſuch that he would ſcorn thy offer, yet ſtill thou mayeſt do him good whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no; thy Prayers are in thy own power, he cannot refuſe the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them; he cannot defeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Charity. Offer therefore thy prayers to God for him, that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart may be forgiven him, and that he may be indued with the ſpirit of Peace and Charity. This laſt branch of duty is the perfection of the other two, and is chiefly intended in this place. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. And thus much may ſuffice briefly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature of this duty.</p>
            <p>I come now to conſider the extent of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42893:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it: For it may be demanded, How oft, and to what degree ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I be bound to forgive him and love him? muſt I always yield to Injuries and Reproaches? Can no wound be ſo deep as to remove my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from my affection, and to juſtifie my revenge? Muſt there be no end of my forbearance and ſuffering? In anſwer to theſe Queries, there are theſe two things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the number and multitude of our Brothers injuries againſt us, we may remember that S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 21. it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he came to Jeſus, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, how oft ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? till ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times? Jeſus ſaith unto him, I ſay not unto thee untill ſeven times: but, untill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times ſeven.</hi> Now by this manner of ſpeech our Saviour plainly intended, not to ſet bounds or limits to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, but to declare rather that it ought to be unlimited, that no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our Brother, how often ſoever they be repeated, ought to exclude him from our forgiveneſs and charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the other part of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, touching the heinouſneſs of our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42893:15"/>
Brothers offences againſt us, it is plain likewiſe, that no degree of guilt in him can put him out of the reach of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, unleſs we alſo would be content that God ſhould exclude us from that forgiveneſs we pray for: for ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath taught us to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> If we therefore forgive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, if we except any of our Brethrens treſpaſſes from our pardon, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth they are too great to be forgiven, what can we expect but that God ſhould deal with us according to our prayers, and leave us under the weight of our moſt hainous tranſgreſſions? and how unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable a burden this would be, judge ye. By what hath been ſaid it is eaſie to conclude, that this precept doth oblige us to an univerſal Forgiveneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards our Enemies, how many and how great ſoever their offences have been.</p>
            <p>There remains one caſe ſtill to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> the Civil Magiſtrate is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God a Revenger, to execute wrath upon them that do evil, not upon thoſe onely who ſin immediately againſt God, but upon thoſe alſo who are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42893:15"/>
to their Neighbours. Nor could Civil Society ſubſiſt without ſuch a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power. It may therefore be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably demanded, that if God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſuch a power amongſt men, for the relief of the injured, and puniſhment of offenders, how can it be unlawful to make uſe of that remedy? and then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all return of evil upon our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is not forbidden by this precept of loving Enemies. Nor would God have appointed his publick Officers for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Injuſtice and Wrong, if the perſons injured might not lawfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead thoſe who did the wrong, and ſeek that reparation which the Laws of God and Man have provided. And indeed if our Saviour did univerſally oblige us tamely to yield to all kind of injuries, without making our juſt defence, or ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reparation from the Law, this would be the direct way to diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and would juſtifie that objection which is wont to be made againſt this precept, that it expoſed good men to ruine and poverty, and gave ſecurity onely to the violent and oppreſſours.</p>
            <p>But to free our Saviours Doctrine from ſo undeſerved a calumny, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42893:16"/>
1. That this Precept is primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a Rule for private perſons, in that capacity, that they ſhould by no means make themſelves judges in their own cauſe, and aſſume to themſelves the power of taking vengeance, and exacting what ſatisfaction they thought fit for the injuries they received. Not but that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Wrong ought to receive its due puniſhment even amongſt men; but becauſe private perſons are not to be truſted in their own concern, therefore God hath reſerved this power to himſelf, and to Magiſtrates commiſſionated by him, for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and the praiſe of them that do well. And to theſe all private perſons ought to refer the judgment of their cauſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of their wrongs; and this I take to be the force of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon, why we ſhould not avenge our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Vengeance belongs to God, the Magiſtrate is Gods Revenger, therefore private perſons muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch authority over their adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42893:16"/>
2. It is to be conſidered further, that there is a wide difference to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween proſecuting an injurious man, and ſeeking revenge. The former of theſe may be done without any breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or diminution of our affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, nay poſſibly it may be the cruelleſt piece of revenge to let men alone in their evil practices, or to ſuffer them to enjoy the fruits of Injuſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling them to account for it. The ſucceſs of unrighteous actions may by degrees harden them in ſin, and bring down the ſeverer judgments of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſhould they eſcape humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. So that to give a timely check to our Neighbour when he deals unjuſtly by us, may poſſibly be a means of gaining our Brother, when private admonitions may not prove effectual. So that this is no ways inconſiſtent with an hearty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and unfeigned charity toward our Enemy. In ſhort then, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully implead thoſe who have done us wrong, onely we muſt obſerve great care and moderation in it; we muſt not go to Law for every trifling and light occaſion, we muſt be careful not to do it with any malicious deſign againſt the perſon we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42893:17"/>
contend with. For though our adverſary be juſtly puniſhed, yet if we purſue him with intention to gratifie our own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his ſufferings, we can in no wiſe be found guiltleſs of the breach of this duty. But thus much may ſuffice for the firſt thing propoſed, the Nature and Extent of the Duty enjoined, <hi>Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſhew the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is laid upon us to the practice of this duty; which I ſhall endeavour to enforce,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the quality of the Law-giver intimated in theſe words, <hi>I ſay unto you.</hi>

               <item>2. From the nature of the Precept.</item>

            </list>
            <p>As for the quality of the Lawgiver ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in thoſe words, <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we look upon our Saviour only as a Prophet come from God to declare his will to Mankind, to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more clearly what it is that the Lord requires of them, yet this alone were ſufficient to challenge our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this, and all his Commands. That God, whoſe Creatures we are, on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42893:17"/>
whom we depend daily for our ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and wel-being, from whom we have received life and breath, and all things we enjoy, and from whom alone we can receive whatever we hope for, this God, whoſe natural born Subjects we are, hath by our Saviour given us the moſt clear and perfect revelation of his will, and doth accordingly by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the moſt entire and univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it. Nor is there any Doctrine he doth more frequently inſiſt on, or more earneſtly perſuade us to obey, than this of the Text, of <hi>Loving Enemies.</hi> The Will of God, whenſoever made known to us, is a ſufficient reaſon of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of his Laws: and our bleſſed Saviour brought with him ſuch undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidences that he came from God, and delivered his Doctrine with ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the truth, and divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of what he ſpake, that he extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his very adverſaries this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>Maſter we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth.</hi> This was that Prophet whom God himſelf ſpake of ſo long before to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 18. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42893:18"/>
               <hi>thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak to them all that I command him; and it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not hearken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him.</hi> And what is meant by thoſe words, <hi>I will require it,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> explains <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 23. where citing this prophecy, he tells us, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs, that every ſoul that will not hear that Prophet, ſhall be cut off from among the people.</hi> If therefore we look upon our Saviour onely as that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet this alone gives ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and obligation to his Precepts, and he might juſtly pronounce <hi>pro Imperio, I ſay unto you love your Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not to look upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour onely as a Prophet; it is true, he was a Prophet <hi>mighty in deed and in word,</hi> but he was withall <hi>much more than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi> for <hi>God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. i. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds.</hi> Now if the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Embaſſadour add any weight or authority to the Meſſage he delivers, then ſurely by how much greater the Son
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42893:18"/>
of God is, than thoſe other Prophets and Miniſters whom God in former Ages ſent forth to declare his will to the World, ſo much more inexcuſable muſt thoſe men be, who reject the precepts of the Goſpel, and refuſe obedience to thoſe Laws which are revealed to them by the Son of God himſelf. This is the inference S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received its due recompence of reward? how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Now if theſe conſiderations may ſeem too remote as having equal influence upon all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required in the Goſpel, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</p>
            <p n="3">3. That our Saviours authority ought to have a more particular force to engage us in the practice of this duty of <hi>Loving Enemies,</hi> becauſe the whole courſe of his life was a continued example of unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded goodneſs and love to thoſe who were his enemies, and he gave us that example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42893:19"/>
in this precept requires nothing more of us, than what he practiſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves in a moſt eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And can we then be unwilling for his ſake to imitate his practice towards our fellow-Creatures? When all fleſh had corrupted their ways before God, and become enemies to him through wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked works, and liable to moſt ſevere vengeance, then it pleaſed the Father out of his moſt tender compaſſion and love to Mankind to ſend his Son out of his boſom, to proclaim Pardon and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them who would repent, and turn from the evil of their ways and would believe and obey that Doctrine which he ſhould teach. Then it pleaſed the Son of God to come down from Heaven, the habitation of Glory, to take upon him our fleſh, and to ſubmit to all the miſeries and ſorrows of humane life; and laſtly, to ſuffer an accurſed, ignominious, and painful death, to redeem us from our iniquities, and to free us from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable vengeance which is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them. And can we think of ſo great condeſcenſion of the Son of God, ſo boundleſs a compaſſion and mighty love, without being tranſported with the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42893:19"/>
moſt fervent affections of Soul to render to him all poſſible demonſtrations of thankfulneſs and obedience? Surely no obedience on our parts can be too great a teſtimony of our thankfulneſs and love to him, by whoſe mercy and goodneſs we are ſo deeply obliged.</p>
            <p>Now the duty of <hi>Loving Enemies</hi> is not onely recommended to our practice by our Saviours authority and example, but is further enjoined as a particular mark and character of his Diſciples, and as the great inſtance of Charity, wherein they ſhould exceed other men. S. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 32. <hi>If ye love them which love you, what thank have you? for ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them. And if ye do good to them, which do good for you, what thank have ye? for ſinners alſo do even the ſame: and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for ſinners alſo lend to ſinners to receive as much again. But love ye your enemies, and do good hoping for nothing again.</hi> So then by our Saviours argument, when we do good to friends onely, we do but as other men, and mind onely our intereſt; but if our charity extends to Enemies, this is pure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Commands of our Saviour.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42893:20"/>
then are we properly called his Diſciples. To conclude therefore this Argument, if the Will of God ſufficiently made known to us have any force to oblige our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, if the authority and example of the Son of God can prevail with us, if the greateſt inſtance of goodneſs and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves can deſerve any ſuitable return from us, then our Saviour may, and doth upon all theſe accounts chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge your obedience to this precept of <hi>Loving Enemies,</hi> as the peculiar inſtance of your duty to him, as the beſt imitation of his charity, and trueſt teſtimony of your love and gratitude. Thus if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the quality of the Law-giver, he is one, who by the juſteſt authority, and greateſt obligations claims obedience to this precept. <hi>I ſay unto you, love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides the authority of the Law-giver, if we conſider further the nature of the Law it ſelf, it will appear much more unreaſonable we ſhould diſobey him. For however uneaſie this may ſeem at the firſt ſight, if we take our meaſures aright, there is no precept that doth more conduce to the quiet contentment of our own minds, the peace of the World, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42893:20"/>
the true dignity and perfection of our Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſult onely our preſent eaſe and ſatisfaction, this onely would in a great meaſure oblige us to paſs by many injuries, and to be kind and curteous towards our Brethren, though they have been injurious to us. And this will beſt appear if we conſider, how burdenſom and uneaſie thoſe paſſions are which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to revenge. Anger and Malice, and Envy and Jealouſie, which are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Attendants of the revengeful man, do raiſe ſuch boiſterous tempeſts, ſuch tumult and diſorder in the ſoul as cannot conſiſt with true peace and ſerenity. So that to give way to them, and cheriſh them in their beginnings, is as dangerous to our repoſe and happineſs, as though we ſhould nouriſh a Snake in our boſome which would leave behind it an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſting and perpetual anguiſh. Tell me, I pray, is any man happy that is eaſily provoked? Can he enjoy the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with other men, who leaves it in the power of any one that dares affront him, to raiſe in him thoſe tempeſtuous paſſions, and to rob him of his repoſe and quiet? Certainly the angry and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42893:21"/>
revengeful man, if he hath an enemy, gives him the greateſt advantages over him that can be. For there is no injury ſo effectual, as that which raiſes diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the mind: ſo that a malicious deſigner always does the intended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, when it is directed againſt a man that indulgeth theſe paſſions. Whereas on the contrary, he that inures himſelf to patience and forbearance, though his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſeek to do him miſchief, yet by this temper of mind he fruſtrates the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his malice, and in ſpite of all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is perfect Maſter of his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In a word, there is no condition of life ſo happy, no enjoyment ſo full of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which can give us the leaſt content, while the deſire of Revenge prevails with us. And of this the Hihory of <hi>Haman</hi> is abundant evidence, which we read <hi>Eſther</hi> v. 11. where <hi>Haman</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving called his friends and kindred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and having told them of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the Princes and Servants of the King, yet ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>All this availeth me nothing, ſo long as Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42893:21"/>
               <hi>the Jew ſitteth at the Kings gate.</hi> So unhappy is the envious and revengeful man amidſt the greateſt proſperity which this World can afford.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next to the peace and quiet of our own minds, this duty of forgiving inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and <hi>loving Enemies</hi> doth highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the peace of the World, and to the preſervation of unity and good will among Chriſtians, as being the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and likely way to reduce our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to peace and friendly agreement with us. There is no man ſo averſe from reconciliation, who will not in time be wrought upon by kindneſs and charity. Enmity will of it ſelf expire, if it be not continued by repeated acts of unkindneſs, how much rather when men find all their injuries repaid with courteſies, all their uncharitable dealings with good deeds. This Argument is made uſe of by S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xii. 20. <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him, if he thirſt, give him drink, for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</hi> Which is not to be underſtood, as though by ſo doing we ſhould deſign to increaſe his condemnation before God. For though poſſibly that may be the event, if notwithſtanding our kindneſs
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42893:22"/>
he continue obſtinate in his malice, yet to deſign that in relieving him would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the cruelleſt piece of revenge and malice. The Apoſtles meaning therefore is, that by doing good to our enemy, and relieving him in his wants, we ſhall kindle in him that fervour of affection and holy fire of Love to us, that he may for the future become our friend, and repent, and be aſhamed of his wickedneſs. This I conceive to be the meaning of <hi>heaping coals of fire upon his head;</hi> and this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the following words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good.</hi> Let no mans injuries or malicious practices towards thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in thy Soul that divine temper of mind, that inclines thee to do good; but endeavour rather by repeated acts of charity towards thine enemy to overcome his enmity, and bring him to agreement and peace with thee.</p>
            <p>This conſideration ought to have great force upon us, becauſe there is nothing more deſirable in this World, than that brethren ſhould live together in unity, nor any thing more agreeable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our moſt holy Religion. When our Saviour was born into the World
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42893:22"/>
Angels attended his birth with this ſong, <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Our Saviour is often called the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and when he left the World, the laſt Legacy he bequeathed to his Diſciples was Peace: <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> Nor ought any thing to be dearer to us, who pretend to be his Diſciples, than this peace; nor ought we to be unwilling to let go much of our right, and to forbear many injuries, and to forego all deſires of revenge, ſo that we may obtain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruits of peace, and live in unity and godly love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From what hath been already ſaid, it is eaſie to conclude, that the practice of this duty doth highly conduce to the true dignity and perfection of our Nature. Thoſe good diſpoſitions of mind that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to be merciful and friendly to others, are the great perfections of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable beings, and we are ſo much more perfect, by how much more enlarged and extenſive they are, and leſs capable of being removed or changed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who is ſo ſetled in the habit of doing good, as not to be withdrawn from it by the injuries and provocations of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42893:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enemy hath gained a victory over himſelf far beyond what he could hope for in purſuance of his revenge, and hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to as great a degree of perfection as he is capable of. For proof of this we may have recourſe to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine nature: for the great perfection of Man, was that he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the image of God, nor is there any thing whereby we attain a nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Divine Nature, than by this univerſal and unreſtrained chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this deſire to good to Enemies as well as Friends. That which makes God the moſt adorable Being in the World, is chiefly his infinite and unchangeable goodneſs. This reaſon is aſſigned by our Saviour to engage us to the duty of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Enemies</hi> in the following Verſe, <hi>That ye may be the children of your Father, which is in heaven; for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rain on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> And at the laſt Verſe concludes his diſcourſe with this advice, <hi>Be ye therefore perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt Argument to perſuade us to forgive and love our Enemies was this, that our greateſt intereſt doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42893:23"/>
depend upon this our practice of it. We have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, and do therefore all of us ſtand in need of pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs at his hands. And can we pray to God for pardon of our own ſins, if we refuſe for his ſake to forgive our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Surely this were a very vain thing to hope for. For what is there can ſeem to render our Neighbour uncapable of forgiveneſs, which doth not aggravate our ſins againſt God infinitely beyond his tranſgreſſions againſt us? If our Neighbours offences againſt us are very many, yet ours againſt God are vaſtly more numerous, if not rather without number. <hi>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> was holy <hi>Davids</hi> queſtion; and it plainly implies that no man can tell. For his own part, though he was the man after Gods own heart, yet he fairly acknowledges that his ſins were more in number than the hairs of his head: and what then muſt we think of our ſelves, who come far ſhort of his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity? Again, are our Neighbours ſins againſt us very hainous and provoking? Ours againſt God are infinitely more ſo. And that upon theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42893:24"/>
two accounts, the infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, the mighty obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have received from God. And theſe are ſuch aggravations of our ſins againſt God, as our Neighbours offences againſt our ſelves are not capable of. For as for men they are all but fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and though there is order and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority amongſt them, yet the diſtance bears no proportion with the infinite and incomprehenſible Majeſty, whereby God is exalted above the Sons of men. If we alſo compare the Benefits we receive from God, with what we confer upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even thoſe alſo bear no reſemblance, and therefore cannot aggravate our Neighbours treſpaſſes againſt us in any proportion with our offences againſt God.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider with our ſelves, that if our ſins againſt God both for the number and aggravation of them are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater than the greateſt of our Neighbours injuries can be; how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably we demean our ſelves, if we pray to God for pardon of our ſins, while we deny forgiveneſs to our Brother for the leſſer offences we have ſuffered at his hands. <hi>Do ye as ye would be done by</hi> is the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42893:24"/>
common rule of equity. Would you therefore that God ſhould ſhew mercy to you, be ye alſo merciful to your fellow-creatures. This is the greateſt equity and reaſon in the World, and God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deal with us according to that rule. So our Saviour tells us, S. <hi>Matt.</hi> vi. 14, 15. <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father will alſo forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> And elſewhere we are aſſured that <hi>he ſhall have judgment without mercy, who hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> And now I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech <note place="margin">James 11. 13.</note> the malicious and revengeful man (if he be capable of being calm) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelf, whether he be able to bear thoſe everlaſting pains which are reſerved for thoſe to whom God refuſeth to ſhew mercy; if he cannot, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, whether it be not his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt intereſt to agree with his adverſary quickly, while he is in the way with him; to ſeek reconciliation with him, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, pray for him, and do him good, that he alſo may be capable of that mercy from God which is not attainable by us, unleſs we from our hearts forgive every man his Brother their treſpaſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42893:25"/>
I ſhall conclude all with the excellent ſayings of the ſon of <hi>Syrach, Ecclus.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>He that revengeth ſhall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will ſurely keep his ſins in remembrance. Forgive thy Neighbour the hurt that he hath done thee, ſo ſhall thy ſins alſo be forgiven thee when thou prayeſt. One man beareth hatred againſt another, and doth he ſeek pardon from the Lord? he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no mercy to a man like himſelf, and doth he ask forgiveneſs of his own ſins? If he that is but fleſh nouriſh hatred, who ſhall intreat for pardon of his ſins?</hi>

            <p>THe belief of our Saviours ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, as it hath a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral influence upon all the parts of a Chriſtian converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo more peculiarly doth it ſerve to diſſuade us from that uncharitable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſo prevailing among men of Judging and Cenſuring the reſt of our Brethren, and is frequently inſiſted on by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, as a moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and cogent argument againſt it.</p>
            <p>For the better enforcement therefore of this prohibition ſo frequent in the Goſpel, I ſhall enquire:
<list>
                  <item>1. What that <hi>Judgment</hi> is, that is here ſo univerſally forbidden.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42893:26"/>
2. The particular force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here uſed to diſſuade us from it, <hi>Becauſe the Lord cometh.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall ſhew the great unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, it is eaſie to underſtand that the Judgment here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is not meant of Judicial procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings either in matters Civil or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical; and this, if from no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may appear from the neceſſity of a Judicial power to the well-being and ſupport of humane ſociety. For that Civil Society cannot ſubſiſt in peace and tranquility without ſufficient authority reſiding in ſome perſons above others, to determine controverſies between man and man, and to execute puniſhment upon thoſe that offer violence to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours is too plain to be inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>For that bad men are vaſtly more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than good, and that ſuch who have no ſenſe of vertue and goodneſs are no other way to be reſtrained from evil, but by the ſeverity of wholſom Laws, and the due execution of them; and that this cannot be without judicial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, every mans experience may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42893:26"/>
If therefore we conſider that God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Order; and that he deſigned man for ſociety and mutual ſupport of each other in it, we cannot perſuade our ſelves that any precept of the Goſpel can tend to the ſubverſion of it, which the taking away Judicial proceedings would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do. Nay, rather ſince Order and Government is ſo neceſſary to our Well-being, we may well conclude that it is derived from God, and from him alone. And agreeably to this the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is ſtiled by our Apoſtle <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, a Revenger, to execute wrath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. xiii. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>upon him that doth evil.</hi> And we are therefore required to yield obedience to them, not onely <hi>for wrath,</hi> but alſo <hi>for conſcience ſake.</hi> Neither is the neceſſity of a Judicial power leſs evident in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſtical than in Civil: nor is the danger of Confuſion and Diſorder greater in the State than in the Church. Therefore when our Saviour ſent forth his Diſciples to gather to him a Church, and make Diſciples of all Nations, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them with the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, with the power of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring and abſolving, of remitting and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42893:27"/>
retaining ſins, agreeable to the demerits of perſons under their juriſdiction; and in obedience to this Commiſſion, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives us ſeveral inſtances of the uſe and exerciſe of this power. By this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority S. <hi>Paul</hi> did deliver <hi>Hymenaeus and Alexander unto Satan, that they might learn to blaſpheme:</hi> as we read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 20. and in the 5. chapter of this Epiſtle, verſe 5. he gives directions to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> to uſe the ſame power over ſuch perſons as were notorious, <hi>to deliver ſuch unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Judgment therefore here and elſewhere ſo frequently forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, cannot be meant of the Judgment of authority in matter either Civil or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither are we forbidden all kind of judgment of the perſons of men from their outward and viſible practices; though we have no ſuperiority over them, we are ſtill allowed the judgment of diſcretion, to diſtinguiſh between man and man, to know whom to avoid and whom to aſſociate our ſelves with, and it is a great part of Chriſtian prudence ſo to do. The actions of many men are ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42893:27"/>
plain and notorious, that they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a mild and eaſie interpretation; and ſhould we ſtay till publick authority had ſet a mark upon ſuch perſons, before we provide for our own innocence and ſecurity by forſaking their acquaintance and converſation, we may in time grow partakers in their iniquity, and be defiled by them. Bad Company and Example do inſenſibly prevail upon our minds, and betray us into evil, and unleſs we were allowed to make a judgment of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the actions we ſee, we could have no reaſon to ſtand upon our guard, or beware of them. Nay further, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity it ſelf, which obligeth us againſt all raſh and malicious cenſures of other men, doth in many caſes not onely allow, but exact of us to make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and be jealous over them, that we be able to afford to them ſeaſonable reproof and admonition, before they are confirmed in a habit of ſin. And to this kind of Judgment, if it be exerciſed with true charity and moderation, out of a zealous concern for the ſoul of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Brother, there is a reward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, S. <hi>James</hi> v. 19. <hi>Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:42893:28"/>
               <hi>him, let him know that he that converteth a ſinner from the evil of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> Now we ſhould be excluded both from this duty and bleſſing, if it were not Iaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to judge of men in ſome meaſure by what we hear and ſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are not forbidden to judge and paſs cenſure upon our ſelves: For this is elſewhere made our duty, and preſcribed to us as a great means to eſcape the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. For this S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 31. <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> And the reaſon is plain: For would men find leiſure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to examine their own lives and actions, and to judge impartially of them, they would not then ſo freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in thoſe practices to which they know the judgement of God is due. They would think themſelves obliged in all times and places, to a more ſtrict and circumſpect walking with God; and when they have through inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and neglect yielded to temptation, by a due examination and judging of themſelves, they would be convinced of the neceſſity of an hearty and ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before they go hence and be no more ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:42893:28"/>
The power of Conſcience was given us by God for that end, that we might be enabled to judge of the good and evil of our actions, and be thereby more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly engaged to continue in well-doing, and eſchew evil, upon a proſpect of a future and more dreadful judgment that would otherwiſe enſue. When therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>verſe</hi> 3. that he judged not his own ſelf. This is not to be underſtood as though he made no judgment at all of his own life and actions, and particularly of his diſcharge of his Apoſtolick Office mentioned in the former Verſes; but that he was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to rely upon his own judgment, but that <hi>although he knew nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> as he declares Verſe 4. <hi>yet he was not thereby juſtified,</hi> in as much as he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be judged by the ſupreme Judge of all the Earth, who knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how he had behaved himſelf, and would judge more impartially than he himſelf could; and then immediately ſubjoins the prohibition of the Text, <hi>Therefore judge nothing before the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore being excepted from the general prohibition, the ſin
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42893:29"/>
which is here forbidden, is the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice of cenſuring and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other men without any probable or juſt grounds, when men take occaſion from little circumſtances and appearances to judge the perſon of their Neighbour, and the inward thoughts and inclinations of his heart. When they take up an ill opinion of him from every idle report, and ſtick not to ſpread and divulge the ſame to his prejudice. When they take all occaſions to leſſen and detract from the good he doth, and aggravate the evil. This unchriſtian practice is capable of many degrees and aggravations, which I ſhall not inſiſt on particularly. I ſhall onely take notice in general, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will conſider calmly with himſelf how he would have his Neighbour deal with him in the like matter, with what candour and ſimplicity he would have him judge of the outward circumſtances of his life, how loth he would be to have the worſt interpretation made of all his words and actions, and how willing he would have others be to admit his excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if not to take away, yet at leaſt to leſſen and alleviate the guilt of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages; ſuch a one cannot but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42893:29"/>
what thoſe degrees of uncharitable judgment are, which are here forbidden. I proceed therefore to the ſecond thing propounded, to ſhew the great unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of this practice, and this will appear from theſe three conſiderations:
<list>
                  <item>1. From the baſeneſs of its original.</item>
                  <item>2. From the greatneſs of the injury done to the perſon we cenſure unjuſtly.</item>
                  <item>3. From the miſchief which redounds to the Publick by uncharitable judgment of one another.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For the original of this practice of cenſuring and reviling one another, I think it may ordinarily be reſolved into one of theſe three Principles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Secret pride and over-valuing our ſelves. Men, who are deſtitute of real worth and yet have a mighty opinion of themſelves, have no other means to buoy up themſelves in that conceit, but to pick faults in the life and actions of other men. And this I doubt is the humour of too many pretenders to the ſtrictneſs of Religion; who, if they declare a great abhorrence of ſome particular fault of their Neighbours, which is contrary to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42893:30"/>
their own natural inclination or preſent intereſt, are apt vainly to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the opinion of their own righteouſneſs, and to vaunt it in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Phariſee, Luke</hi> xviii. 10. <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican.</hi> Now the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable folly of this method of proceeding, no man can be ignorant of, that conſiders the nature and genius of true Religion; that it doth not conſiſt in the abſtinence from ſome particular ſins, which I may apprehend others to be guilty of, but in an univerſal obedience to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God. And therefore what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageth it me to be able to declaim zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly againſt this or that Vice of the Age I live in, or the perſons with whom I converſe, if I cheriſh in my boſom other impieties, which, if not ſo open and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, may yet be as inconſiſtent with my ſalvation as any other. If we will take our Saviours judgment in the caſe, the poor Publican, though conſcious of ſo many faults and infirmities, and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy judged and condemned by the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, was yet in a much fairer way to be juſtified before God, than the other, who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42893:30"/>
did not ſeem to apprehend that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any repentance. Now were men truly humble and conſcious of their own manifold defects and miſcarriages, they would find infinite more reaſon to turn the edge of their cenſure upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There is no man who will take pains to ſearch into the ſecrets of his own ſoul, but may find himſelf guilty of more faults than he can reaſonably ſuſpect or accuſe his Neighbour of. We ſee onely the external geſture and behaviour of other men, and cannot eaſily determine from what principle their actions flow: we do not know all the circumſtances they are engaged in, which will much alter the nature of the actions we judge them for. We cannot tell what we our ſelves ſhould do in the like caſe, and how far we may be able to reſiſt the ſame temptations. Whereas we may eaſily know the true grounds of our own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, that the blame of them is due onely to our ſelves. So that every man hath upon this account much greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think and ſpeak well of other men, than of himſelf. But now if notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this evidence, men may have of their own guiltineſs above that of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42893:31"/>
they can give themſelves the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty zealouſly to declaim againſt the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed faults of other men, this muſt needs argue an unreaſonable degree of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and proud overlooking thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and follies which may be found at home in their own boſome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A further ground of this uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice, is Idleneſs, and a groſs neglect of our own neceſſary affairs. The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own ſalvation is of ſo near and great concern to us, that unleſs we be very negligent of it, we cannot find leiſure to prie into, and condemn the miſcarriages of others. Our life here is ſhort enough to fit and prepare us for that unalterable ſtate which we are haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to; and can we think it reaſonable to ſpend any of thoſe pretious hours which are never to be recalled, in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo little concern to us, as the faults and follies of other men<hi>:</hi> eſpecially when they may be imployed to ſo great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in furthering our journey, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating our admiſſion to that glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which we all pretend to ſeek after? Surely did men ſeriouſly conſider, that their title to an eternal and never-fading inheritance did depend upon the wiſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42893:31"/>
management of a few days here, that the very beſt of mankind, when they had done all they could, were but unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervants, and that our future condition would be determined, not according to other mens actions, but our own, they would think it much more reaſonable to ſpend that leiſure they had in the ſearch and examination of their own ſouls, while there is room left to repent and amend, leſt while they are impertinently buſie in inquiring into, and cenſuring the actions of other men, they themſelves ſhould be ſurpriſed by the evil day, and ſnatched away unprepared to the great Tribunal. Every mans own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore being of ſo great and weighty a concern, he that is really mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it, can have no further leiſure to obſerve the failings and miſcarriages of other men, than to take occaſion from thence to exerciſe that great part of Chriſtian charity, which conſiſts in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproof and admonition where it may be given; and when it may not, to take heed to himſelf, leſt he alſo be tempted; and if any man ſuffer himſelf to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond theſe bounds, to cenſure and condemn other men, he juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42893:32"/>
the reproof in the Comedy:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tantúmne ab re tuâ eſt otii tibi,</l>
               <l>Aliena ut cures, eaque nihil quae ad te at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent?</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3. A further occaſion of uncharitable cenſures, is Intereſt and Deſign. When men make the diſreputation of other men the ſtep to their own advancement in the World; and of this the experience is too manifeſt: this being a diſeaſe that widely ſpreads it ſelf among all ſorts and conditions of men. How ſeldom do we ſee any matter of intereſt decided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many hard ſpeeches, and unjuſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the perſons we contend with? How apt are men to take advantage of every little circumſtance of anothers life that is capable of an ill interpretation, when it may ſuit their intereſt to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him? There is a ſort of politick and deſigning men in the World, who can converſe familiarly, and ſpeak friendly to their Neighbour, and be laviſh in his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, till a competition of Intereſt happen between them; but then all his good deeds had ſome ſiniſter deſign blended with them: they can then diſcover many
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42893:32"/>
circumſtances which are apt to create ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, and thoſe ſuſpicions are ſoon ſpread with ſo much aggravation, as though the ſuſpected faults were real and evident<hi>:</hi> and when they have ſaid the utmoſt they can to leſſen his eſteem, they can ſtill expreſs a great tenderneſs for the reputation of the man, and that they are loth to ſay or think the worſt of him.</p>
            <p>Beſides the greatneſs of the injury, and other bad effects of this way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I ſhall have occaſion to inſiſt on more particularly, that which I ſhall at preſent take notice of, to ſhew the great unreaſonableneſs of it, is this, that none but bad men and a bad cauſe can ſtand in need of it. He that purſues his own intereſt and advancement for no other ends but ſuch as are juſt and reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> that he may be able with more freedom to diſcharge his duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and Man, and be in better ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to do good in the World. Such a one will conſider, that there is no ſuch great need of his advancement in the World, but that another man in the ſame ſtate and condition may diſcharge the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of that ſtate as well as he. And in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42893:33"/>
the mean time he may ſatisfie himſelf, that the duties he performs in a lower ſphere, are as acceptable to God, and leſs diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to himſelf, than if he were raiſed higher: and then what temptation can ſuch a man have to exalt himſelf with ſo great an injury done to another man? And this leads me to the ſecond thing propounded, to ſhew the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of uncharitable judgment of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, from the greatneſs of the injury we do by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an injury againſt which there is no defence. He that aſſaults a man by open violence, may be reſtrained by the uſe of our own power againſt his; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the publick authority of Laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our ſecurity, and men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to aſſiſt and ſuccour the weak againſt the violence of an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor: but the tongue of the malicious and cenſorious woundeth in ſecret, and it is hard to know from whence our harm ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. A ſlanderous report ſpreads wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſenſibly; nor can a man be able to trace out the beginnings, or ſtop the progreſs of it. Nay many times the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is improved beyond the intentions of him that deviſed it. If but a bare ſuſpicion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42893:33"/>
be put in the minds of the giddy and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous multitude, how eaſily doth it gain credit as true? and then ſuddenly a thouſand circumſtances are added to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the guilt; ſo that it is not in the power of the greateſt wiſdom or vertue to reſiſt wholly, or ſtop the progreſs of a falſe accuſation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greatneſs of this injury will appear yet more manifeſtly in that we cannot make ſufficient reparation for it. He that hath been the Author of a falſe report, though he ſhould afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be ſorry for it, though he ſhould ask forgiveneſs of the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, and take all occaſions for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to wipe off all ſuſpicions which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had raiſed; yet after all is done, much of the report will be believed whether he will or not. It may be ſpread through many places, wherein after-confeſſion cannot reach; and even then men are apter to believe the bad report than the good. Men will not lay aſide a prejudice once entertained, without greater evidence to the contrary, than what cauſed it at firſt; and ſuch evidence it will be hard to give to all perſons who have believed a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A malicious cenſure may meet with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42893:34"/>
many perſons who may think it their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to continue the belief of it, though the firſt inventor ſhould repent. So that when once an uncharitable judgment is made and divulged, I cannot ſee how it can be in the power of him that did it, to ſtop the belief, or ſpreading of it, or to make reparation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A further aggravation of this ſin is, that no kind of injury doth more afflict the ſpirit of a man, or make a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than a falſe and uncharitable judgment of him. Every man hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a great reverence for a good name; and agreeably to his value of it, cannot but highly reſent to be deprived of it by a falſe and unjuſt accuſation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon</hi> compares the <hi>words of a ſlanderer and back-biter to the piercing of a ſword, Prov.</hi> xi. 18. And holy <hi>David</hi> tells us that <hi>ſwords are in their lips, Pſal.</hi> lix. 7. Neither is it without good reaſon that men are thus tender of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good name, in as much as it is one of the great inſtruments whereby men are enabled to do good in the World; and to be diſabled from that, is one of the moſt juſt occaſions of grief and diſſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:42893:34"/>
A man, who out of conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, makes it his ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do what good he can in the place and ſtation to which God hath called him, cannot but be deeply affected with ſuch an injury, as makes his endeavours ineffectual for that end; and though he may be ſo charitable as to forgive, yet it cannot but cauſe a great unquietneſs of ſpirit in a good man, which cannot eaſily be attoned for. But this is not a private injury onely, but hath very great and malignant influence upon the ſociety in which we live. Which brings me to the third conſideration propoſed, to ſhew the great unreaſonableneſs of uncharitable judging of one another; namely the bad effects which redound from this practice to the Publick.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt of thoſe bad effects, which I ſhall inſiſt on, is that which I juſt now mentioned, that it renders particular perſons leſs able to do good in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places and callings, than otherwiſe they might be. And this muſt needs be a great injury to the Publick, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the ſeveral abilities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the perſons ſo dealt with. Now that ſlanderous reports and falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42893:35"/>
ſpread concerning the perſons of any men, do tend much to hinder the good they might do otherwiſe, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove by inſtancing in two ſorts of men, whoſe ability to do good, doth in great meaſure depend upon the reverence and eſteem of their perſons, which muſt conſequently be much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by malicious and uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, and even by the undue mention of faults that are true and real, but yet are no mans buſineſs to enquire into, or accuſe them for.</p>
            <p>The perſons I mean, are publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters either in the Church or State. For the latter of theſe it is a thing of common experience, that the great ſtrength and ſecurity of any Nation conſiſts in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good correſpondence between the ſeveral parts of it: when thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern apply themſelves zealouſly for the good of the Community; and when Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on the other hand are hearty and ſincere in their obedience to thoſe that rule over them. Now it muſt needs be granted, that nothing more effectually engages the obedience and affection of Subjects to their Soveraign and Miniſters imployed by him, than a firm belief of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42893:35"/>
their wiſdom and integrity in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their reſpective imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whoever therefore makes it their deſign, as many buſie-bodies are apt to do, to miſ-repreſent all the proceedings of their Governours, that ſuit not with their preſent humour and underſtanding, and to rip up and aggravate thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faults of ſuch perſons which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them not: ſuch perſons, I ſay, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be thought highly injurious to the Publick, by abating the reverence and eſteem, which is juſtly due and of great uſe to ſuperiours in the execution of the great truſt committed to them. But in the name of God, what do men of this temper propoſe to themſelves? Do they think their Governours are not men of Paſſion and Infirmities as well as others? Do they not know that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments they are ingaged in, are of more variety and difficulty, than can be managed with ſo exact evenneſs, but there will be ſtill ſome inconveniences unavoidable? How is it that they do not obſerve, that even then when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, and cenſure the perſons and actions of their Governours, they do in a great meaſure contribute to, and increaſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42893:36"/>
the inconveniences they ſuffer. For it is vain to imagine that inconveniences of any Government ariſe wholly or chiefly from the faults and miſcarriages of men in authority, but in great part from the perverſe and ungovernable tempers of ſome men, who ſtudy to be unquiet, and for that reaſon ſtick not to declaim zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly againſt all the actions of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, which they think capable of blame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of perſons, whoſe abilities to do good, depend much upon the reverence and eſteem of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are the Miniſters of the Church. Now the buſineſs of theſe men being of ſo great importance, as the ſalvation of the immortal ſpirits of men; whoever hinders the ſucceſs of their endeavours in that affair, may juſtly be eſteemed a common enemy to mankind. Now I do not underſtand any way whereby men do more directly undermine the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our holy Faith, and hinder the enlargement of it, than by defaming the perſons to whom the delivery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, and the Miniſtry of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is intruſted. For though it be a very unſafe and unreaſonable way of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42893:36"/>
arguing, for any man to disbelieve the truth of Chriſtian Religion, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the practice of it, becauſe this or that particular man in Holy Orders is unfaithful to his own ſoul, and lives not up to the purity and perfection which he preacheth to others; yet certainly it is an argument which doth extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the World, and is equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, whether it be grounded on the real, or but ſuppoſed faults of men, whoſe Office it is to inſtruct or perſuade others to the practice of holineſs. For to him who believes a falſe report of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Guide, the occaſion of Scandal is as effectual, as though the report were true, and the cenſure juſt: and then who can perſuade himſelf that the man who raiſed the falſe accuſation is not as injurious to the Church, as the man whoſe life is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcandalous? What hath been ſaid of the ill effect that redounds to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick from the uncharitable cenſurings of men of this publick capacity, will in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion hold concerning the raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we make of private perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral degrees wherein they may be uſeful either in the Church or Commonwealth.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:42893:37"/>
2. I proceed to a ſecond inſtance of the ill effects which redound to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by our uncharitable judging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, that our raſh and cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious practice towards others, provokes the like uſage from them towards our ſelves; and thence ariſes thoſe many feuds and animoſities, mutual revilings, and bitter envyings, ſo viſible among men of all conditions; and a feud thus begun, commonly ſpreads it ſelf, and all our friends and correſpondents are ſoon made partners in the quarrel; and how hard it is to lay aſide or allay thoſe animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities which have been thus begun, every mans experience may convince him. Now I need not uſe any arguments to ſhew that diviſions and animoſities among men, are of very dangerous conſequence to the publick Society where they live; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a truth atteſted by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Mankind, and by the experience of all Ages; ſo that we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whatever practices tend to the begetting and increaſe of ſtrife and contention, are very hurtful to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>Nor do I know any practice that doth more effectually tend that way, than this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42893:37"/>
of uncharitable judging and cenſuring other men. How much the greater the end and deſign of any Society is, ſo much more dangerous and hurtful thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are to be eſteemed which cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in it. The Church of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being a Society, whoſe happineſs is not terminated in the temporal peace and tranquillity of this life, we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that thoſe uncharitable cenſures which cauſe diviſions among Chriſtians, receive from hence a mighty aggravation in that they do not onely hinder their preſent peace and tranquillity, but endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their falling ſhort of that eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is promiſed to none that do not follow after peace and holineſs. And from this conſideration that we are all members of the Church of Chriſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but add a third ill effect which this uncharitable practice of judging and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring one another brings to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Viz.</hi> That it brings reproach upon our Chriſtian Profeſſion, and upon that Holy Name whereby we are called. For ſuppoſe a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Pagan</hi> ſhould peruſe the writings of the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, and ſhould read there the many
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42893:38"/>
precepts which require of us the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt degree of meekneſs and humility in our opinions and judgments of other men; ſhould they read <hi>S. Pauls</hi> deſcription of Chriſtian Charity, that it <hi>thinketh no evil,</hi> that it <hi>believeth all things,</hi> and <hi>hopeth all things;</hi> did they conſider the many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments the Goſpel uſes to enforce the duty, and great reward undiſpenſably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon our practice; and laſtly the example of our Saviour himſelf, who in his converſation among men, was the greateſt enemy to all uncharitable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, but did himſelf exerciſe the greateſt candor towards all men, ſcarce ever paſſing a ſevere cenſure upon any, but that proud cenſorious Sect of the Phariſees, who made themſelves judges of all others: ſhould they then deſcend to compare the practice of Chriſtians with that excellent rule they pretend to, and with the example of their Lord and Saviour, and ſee how vaſt the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is between our Practice and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would eaſily perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the generality of Chriſtians did not ſeriouſly believe the Doctrine they vaunt of, nor own the authority of their Saviour in giving Laws for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42893:38"/>
of their lives, nor expect the accompliſhment of thoſe things which he hath foretold. They will find it very hard to reconcile, how the belief of thoſe things can conſiſt with many uncharitable practices, unjuſt reproaches, and mutual enmities which the profeſt Diſciples of the bleſſed Jeſus are ſo eaſily tempted to. Thus, beſides the injury we do to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, and to the publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof we ſhould be feeling mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, we caſt a ſtumbling block in the way of thoſe who might be won over to our moſt holy Profeſſion, did they not ſee the Profeſſors of it ſo manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in their lives and practices, what they plead for with ſo much zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the third thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſhew the particular force of the argument here uſed to diſſuade from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable judging one another: <hi>Becauſe the Lord cometh.</hi> And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the conſideration of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge, if compared with our great inability to judge aright. This branch of the argument is particularly urged by our Apoſtle in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42893:39"/>
my Text; <hi>Judge nothing before the time until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden works, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good and evil of what men do, cannot be determined barely from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances, which onely are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the knowledge of men. Many actions may proceed from an heart truly pious and devout, which may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God that knows the heart, which yet as to men may be liable to ſuſpicion and miſtake. On the other ſide the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions of hypocrites may appear to men as inſtances of great piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, when to God they are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Now ſhould we uſe the utmoſt of our diſcretion in theſe caſes, we could have no ſufficient ground to judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe men or their actions. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the ſecret windings and private retirements of the heart of man; ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious his thoughts and intentions, and ſo numerous his pretences to diſguiſe his actions, that it is not in the power of any mortal eye, though never ſo impartial, to diſcern rightly of him or his actions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are few men ſo impartial in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42893:39"/>
their judgment as to take in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances even of outward appearance, we too frequently paſs cenſure according to our own preconceived opinions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and are often biaſſed by our zeal, intereſts or affections, which do uſually as much miſ-repreſent perſons and actions to our underſtanding, as coloured Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums do objects to the eye. Thence ariſes the great difference between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral judgments men make of the ſame things. Nay, ſo deceitful is the heart of man, ſo hardly to be ſearched into, that we are not competent Judges of our own actions. We have many arts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, many ſecret evaſions and falſe pretences to beget an opinion of our own worth and righteouſneſs, and to hide our ſelves, if I may ſo ſay, from our own ſouls, and then how can we hope to make a right judgment of other men? But now the Lord, who is to come, is of infinite knowledge, and 'tis his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive alone to underſtand the thoughts of man, and the counſels of his heart.</p>
            <p>This God teſtifieth of himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> xvii. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart, I trie the</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42893:40"/>
               <hi>reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi> Again, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiv. 12. <hi>If thou ſayeſt, behold we knew it not, doth not he which pondereth the heart conſider it, and he that keepeth thy ſoul, doth not he know it?</hi> The all-ſeeing eye of God can diſcern thoſe inwards acts of piety which a good man is imployed in, though they meet with cenſure and reproach among men; and can as eaſily unmask all the falſe pretences of the Hypocrite, ſince all things are naked and open before him. Now the conſequences of theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to diſſuade us from judging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time is eaſie and obvious. For what more reaſonable motive to reſtrain our curioſity in prying into, and cenſuring the actions of others, than that the exact knowledge of thoſe things is too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for us, and that we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it; and withall that there is a judgment to come, when, if we make a falſe and uncharitable judgment, we ſhall be plainly convinced of it before God and all his holy Angels, and then who can perſuade himſelf, that it will not be a matter of great ſhame and confuſion of face, to ſee thoſe men, whom we had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42893:40"/>
cenſured and reviled, receive praiſe from the unerring judgment of God, and for thoſe very actions which we here condemned, made partakers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Righteouſneſs, the Crown of Glory and Immortality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A further conſideration to diſſuade from all uncharitable judgment is, that the Lord, who is to come, and he alone, hath power and authority to judge. That Lord, whoſe Creatures we are, and on whom we depend daily for our ſupport and well-being, hath onely abſolute right and dominion over us: and except in thoſe caſes where he hath delegated his authority to Princes, Parents, and other Governours to judge of, and determine thoſe outward actions that concern So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, he hath reſerved the power of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Laws to mankind, and of judging according to them to himſelf onely. And therefore, beſides the preſumption which while we judge others we are guilty of our ſelves, by boldly intruding into thoſe things which we know not, we do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſacrilegiouſly invade the royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God, to whom alone judgment belongeth. This is St. <hi>James</hi>'s argument, <hi>James</hi> iv. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giver able</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42893:41"/>
               <hi>to ſave and to deſtroy, who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt anothers ſervant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude. Thirdly and laſtly, we ought not to judge before the time, becauſe the Lord cometh, who will be the ſevere avenger of all uncharitable judgment of our brethren. This he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſures us, S. <hi>Matt.</hi> vii. 1, 2. <hi>Judge not that you be not judged; for with what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged; and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> And from this ground S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Therefore thou inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, O man, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame things.</hi> Verſe the third. <hi>And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them that do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhouldeſt eſcape the judgment of God.</hi> Now I conceive the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equally cogent, whether he be underſtood here to ſpeak of the ſame ſins <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> or rather of other ſins of equal guilt. Since the unreaſonableneſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Neighbour for ſome particular
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42893:41"/>
ſins, when we are guilty of others as hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, is altogether as evident as though we did the ſame things we condemn him for. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in the latter part of that Chapter, when he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the ſame argument makes his inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not only in ſins of the ſame kind, but of equal degree, Verſe 22. <hi>Thou that abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Idols, committeſt thou Sacriledge?</hi> And now let any man conſider how dreadful his condition muſt needs be at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day, if the Lord who is to come ſhould be extreme to mark what he hath done amiſs, and ſhould deal with him according to the utmoſt rigour of the Law, and then he cannot want ſufficient arguments to perſuade him to a meek and candid interpretation of the faults of others, eſpecially if he call to mind that God hath declared, that <hi>he ſhall have judgment without mercy, which hath ſhewed no mercy:</hi> which ſhewing of mercy doth not conſiſt barely in the relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the wants of thoſe that are in miſery, but in an univerſal charity, as well in our thoughts and judgments of others, and in an humble forbearance of their faults and infirmities, as in other acts of bounty and liberality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42893:42"/>
It remains now ſince we all believe, and are aſſured that our Lord will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to judge the World, that we behave our ſelves as men that wait for his coming; as by all other Exerciſes of Holy Living, ſo more particularly by Meekneſs and Charity towards others: that laying aſide all raſh and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cenſures of other men, we may be in ſome meaſure capable of receiving the promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 37. <hi>Judge not and ye ſhall not be judged: condemn not and ye ſhall not be condemned.</hi>

            <p>HE that conſiders with himſelf the great variety of Opinions in matters of Religion, which have prevailed in the Chriſtian World, and the great zeal and animoſities wherewith men of different perſuaſions are wont to maintain the diſtinguiſhing opinions of their Party, ſcarce allowing thoſe that differ from them any probable hopes of ſalvation. He that conſiders this, muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe one of theſe two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:42893:43"/>
Either that the way of obtaining the knowledge of divine truth is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plain and certain, ſo that all that uſe a due diligence in the ſearch after it, may reaſonably hope to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, that the generality of Chriſtians that maintain ſo wide differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about matters of Religion, do not ſeek for knowledge after a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the way of ſalvation is not ſufficiently plain, and that all, who uſe a due diligence in the ſearch of it, may not reaſonably hope to find it; this cannot be granted without injury and affront to the divine goodneſs and juſtice. For ſince the eternal welfare of all Chriſtians doth depend upon their due performance of the condition of Chriſtianity, and this cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without a competent knowledge of thoſe things that are revealed in the Goſpel; if theſe things were ſo dark and obſcure, that even the plaineſt Chriſtian might not attain to as great a degree of knowledge as is neceſſary for him, it would then follow, that God had not taken ſufficient care of his people, to make the way of ſalvation known to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42893:43"/>
them: and withall that he dealt very hardly and unmercifully with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them, in excluding them from the means of knowledge, when yet he hath annexed ſo great a penalty to the want of it, as their falling ſhort of that eternal inheritance to which they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The true reaſon therefore why ſo many enquirers after knowledge do miſcarry in their deſign, and are led away into ſtrange and dangerous opinions, is not becauſe the knowledge of the truth is ſo hard to be obtained, but becauſe there are but few that apply themſelves to the ſearch of it after a due manner. It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but ſeem neceſſary, that while we all pretend to ſeek after knowledge, and to deſire to be informed in thoſe important truths revealed in the Goſpel, that we firſt of all endeavour to ſatisfie our ſelves concerning the true way and method, by which the knowledge we ſeek after is to be obtained: and this our Saviour hath directed us to in theſe words, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fore-going Verſes of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42893:44"/>
we read that there was <hi>great murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring among the people</hi> concerning our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who about that time begun to ſhew himſelf to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and there was great variety of opinions concerning him. <hi>Some ſaid, he is a good man, others ſaid, nay; but he deceiveth the people.</hi> Now to decide this controverſie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf, and the doctrine he taught, he gives them this plain direction, <hi>if any man will do his will;</hi> intimating thereby, that they who thus diſputed concerning him, had not that true frame of mind that was fit for his reception: that they were not willing to obey God, whatever they pretended, and therefore that it was in vain for them to be ſo inquiſitive about him. For to what purpoſe ſhould they look for further revelations and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from God, when they refuſed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that doctrine they had already received, and which they knew to be divine? For to this purpoſe he upbraids them, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Did not Moſes give you the Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law?</hi> So then, had the Jews been obedient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Law, as they pretended great admiration of it, they could not have found ſo many difficulties in their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42893:44"/>
owning our Saviour for the true Meſſias, they would then eaſily have underſtood that he came from God, and that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he taught was truly divine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and that he did not endeavour to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, as they were wont to object againſt him, but that he did eminently and exactly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt on this ſtrict conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the words with the foregoing and following Verſes, I ſhall now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, not as having any peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Jews, but as they are a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule for all enquirers after divine truth: <hi>If any man,</hi> whoſoever he be, Jew or Gentile, <hi>will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of theſe words, I ſhall firſt endeavour to explain the nature of the condition, which our Saviour here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in order to the ſearch of divine truth.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall ſhew the certainty of ſucceſs to all ſuch as ſeek for knowledge after this manner here required.</p>
            <p>1. For the condition it ſelf, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42893:45"/>
               <hi>whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> This condition implies in it theſe four things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A previous ſenſe of the divine So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over us, and our obligation to do whatſover God commands. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Supreme Authority of God, is antecedently neceſſary to all enquiries after divine truth. For he that would be ſatisfied concerning the truth of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kind of Religion, muſt in the firſt place ſuppoſe that ſome religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is due from men to God; and this is of ſo natural an evidence and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there neither is, nor hath been any Nation of the World, wherein they have not had a ſenſe of the Being of God, and of his ſupreme right to give Laws to Mankind; and that our well-being and happineſs doth depend upon our doing thoſe things which are well-pleaſing to him; and therefore we find, that how far ſoever the Nations of the World had erred concerning the Nature of God, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributing to him thoſe unworthy paſſions and practices which a wiſe man would be aſhamed of; yet ſtill they thought it neceſſary to find out ſome way of expreſſing their homage to him.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42893:45"/>
And though the ways of Worſhip deviſed by the Heathens were commonly very abſurd and ridiculous, yet thus much is abundantly evident from their practice, that they owned an obligation to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip of God, and had a ſenſe of his ſoveraignty and right to govern them, and to diſpoſe of them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
            <p>And this ſenſe of his divine Soveraignty is neceſſarily ſuppoſed in this condition, <hi>If any man will do his will.</hi> For no man can intend to do the will of God, who is not before perſuaded that he ought to do it, whenſoever it is made known to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This condition, <hi>if any man will do his will,</hi> implies or preſuppoſes a ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the will of God in order to practice, and a diligent uſe of thoſe means of inſtruction which God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us: as <hi>viz.</hi> a ſearch of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, a ſober uſe of our Reaſon in the examination of it, a diligent attendance on thoſe ſpiritual Guides which God hath ſet over us for our inſtruction in the way of righteouſneſs; and prayer to God for the guidance and aſſiſtance of his good Spirit, to enable us to underſtand and do
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42893:46"/>
thoſe things which are neceſſary for us, and to lead us into all truth. For we are not to underſtand this promiſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as though God would infuſe the knowledge of divine truth by a miracle; but that thoſe that will do the will of God, ſhall be bleſt by him in the diligent uſe of thoſe ordinary means which he hath appointed for their inſtruction. And therefore in the old Oeconomy the Jews were referred to <hi>Moſes</hi> for their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, what they ought to do. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, <hi>God hath given ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Saints, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt;</hi> and to theſe men and their ſucceſſors we muſt have recourſe in order to inſtruction, and ſatisfaction in matters of Religion. To theſe themſelves we may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they have left behind them as a certain guide to us in all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if we be not wanting to our ſelves. To their Succeſſors we have recourſe in our attendance upon the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who derive their commiſſion by a continued ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42893:46"/>
who were impowered by Chriſt to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others, for the continuance of their Office to the end of the World. And to theſe perſons thus impowered all private Chriſtians ought to apply themſelves with humility and diligence for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and in the diligent uſe of thoſe means of knowledge above-mentioned, he that <hi>will do the will of God,</hi> by vertue of this promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>ſhall know of the doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This condition, <hi>if any man will do his will,</hi> implies further, that in our ſearch after divine truth, and in our uſe of thoſe means of knowledge which God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us, we muſt propoſe to our ſelves the doing the will of God, as the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end of our knowledge.</p>
            <p>This is that which is more particularly expreſſed in the Text. Many there are, who are very inquiſitive after truth, but they have oft-times very different and undue ends in their enquiry: ſometimes they do it to gratifie their curioſity; ſometimes that they may be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Party they are ingaged in, with ſome plauſible ſhew of reaſon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do it for oſtentation and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, that they may appear wiſer and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42893:47"/>
more learned than their neighbours; and ſometimes they ſeek for knowledge, as other men do their Merchandiſe, that they may make a gain of it, and provide for their ſubſiſtence in the World. Now Now all theſe ſeveral ſorts of Enquirers may poſſibly attain the ſeveral ends they propoſe to themſelves; they may grow learned and wiſe in the ordinary account of men, they may grow rich, and gain eſteem and applauſe among men, and in this they have their reward; but ſtill they may want the true knowledge and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which our Saviour here ſpeaks of; which is not attainable by any that do not intend and reſolve to do the will of God according to their knowledge; this alone makes them capable of a full and ſenſible conviction of the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and excellency of thoſe revelations which are contained in the Goſpel. For it is not every one that can talk ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about religious matters, or that can give a tolerable account of the rational grounds, upon which the truth of the Goſpel is conveyed to us; not every one that can diſpute learnedly about points of Faith, and decide Controverfies; not every one that is thus accompliſhed, is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42893:47"/>
properly ſaid <hi>to know of the doctrine</hi> in our Saviours ſenſe. No, he that is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>to do the will of God</hi> abſolutely and entirely, ſuch a one ſhall receive a more full and ample ſatisfaction concerning thoſe things that are neceſſary for him, than can be gained by the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and moſt convincing demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He ſhall find in his ſoul a lively ſenſe of the excellency of thoſe truths which the Goſpel delivers, ſuch as ſhall leave no room for doubtfulneſs or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt not onely intend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do the will of God, and propoſe to our ſelves this, as the great end of our enquiry; but we muſt actually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſcharge thoſe duties we already know, if we hope to attaim to a ſufficient ſatisfaction in our Religion: for he that neglects to do the will of God, as far as he already knows, he cannot be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have a ſincere reſolution of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to thoſe further inſtructions which he may find in the Goſpel. And indeed in this place our Saviour may well be underſtood to exact this qualification of thoſe who came to hear him, that they ſhould practiſe thoſe duties they already
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42893:48"/>
knew, if they would be ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of his Religion; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may ſeem an improper and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous way of proceeding, to perſuade men firſt to obey the Goſpel, and then to promiſe them ſatisfaction about the truth of it. Men are not willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a way of living ſo ſtrict and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as the Goſpel enjoyns, without being ſatisfied before hand of the truth of it; that that is truly the will of God, which is there required, and that it is their great duty and intereſt to obey it. Nay it is manifeſt by ſad experience, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are convinced of the truth of the Goſpel, are yet very backward to practiſe the precepts of it; but how much more unwillingly would they undertake this practice, if they were not capable of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about the truth of the Goſpel, till they had obeyed it. So that it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the doing the will of God here ſpoken of, muſt in part be underſtood of thoſe previous inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the will of God, which thoſe who came to hear our Saviour had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>The Jews, to whom our Saviour here directs his diſcourſe, had the inſtructions
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42893:48"/>
of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; from whom they might have underſtood the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal rules of good living; and their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets would doubtleſs have been a great preparation for their reception of the Goſpel; and then for thoſe Enquirers after truth, who have been bred up in a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, they cannot be ſuppoſed to be wholly ignorant of their duty. No man can ordinarily grow up in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Society to an age capable of ſuch enquiries, but muſt have been compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently inſtructed in the general rules of good living, in the ſubſtantial and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary parts of Religion. Thoſe three great branches of Duty which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us to be the ſumme of the Goſpel, the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in the World,</hi> are in themſelves of ſo evident an obligation, that no man who hath come to the uſe of Reaſon, eſpecially in a Chriſtian Common-wealth, can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that it is his duty to live ſo. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we then a man competently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the general rules of good living, whether by the Law of Nature written in his mind or conſcience, as was the caſe of the better ſort of Heathens, or by the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42893:49"/>
Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Jews were in our Saviours time.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly, by the benefit of a Chriſtian education, as the ſtate of thoſe among our ſelves is, who come to examine the truth of the Goſpel, and to enquire more nearly into the ſenſe of it. Suppoſe we a man already inſtructed by any of theſe means in the fundamental rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, deſirous of further knowledge and ſatisfaction in the doctrine of the Goſpel, he muſt be careful to live up to thoſe principles he is already inſtructed in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving alſo to ſubmit obediently to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe, upon his further enquiry, he ſhall find to be his duty. Such a man thus prepared by doing his duty, and thus reſolved to do the will of God, as far as it ſhall be made known to him, ſuch a one is the perſon to whom this promiſe of our Savior doth belong. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the ſecond thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſhew the certainty of ſucceſs to thoſe that ſeek for knowledge with this preparation; and here it will not be amiſs to conſider briefly in what ſenſe this promiſe is to be underſtood, before
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42893:49"/>
we undertake to prove the certainty of it. We are to obſerve therefore, that this promiſe of our Saviour is not to be underſtood ſo univerſally, as though no man, who was ſincerely reſolved to obey God, ſhall fall into any kind of errours in matters of Religion. For this is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the conſtant experience of all Ages: for it would be very uncharitable to ſuppoſe, that among moſt of the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parties in Religion, who maintain great controverſies with one another, there ſhould not be ſome perſons truly devout and ſincere on both ſides. We are not therefore to ſuppoſe that a man truly religious ſhall not err at all; but that he ſhall not be led into ſuch errors as are dangerous to, or inconſiſtent with his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And indeed the promiſe in this place is not ſet down in ſo general terms, as that they ſhould ſeem to require any larger interpretation than this I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; <hi>If any man will do his will,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>he ſhall know of the doctrine,</hi> I now beliver to you, <hi>whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be extended beyond theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſhall receive ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42893:50"/>
the truth of Chriſtian Religion in general, that it is a doctrine truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly, and that the author of it came from God, and delivered his mind and will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He that will do the will of God</hi> ſhall be ſatisfied alſo, concerning thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular truths, which are indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to know, in order to his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things will be the undou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted effects of a religious frame of mind, of a ſincere reſolution to do the will of God, and will certainly be made good to all, who ſeek for knowledge with that preparation; and this we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſſured of, whether we conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The natural influence that a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious temper of mind hath upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to make it fit for the rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of divine truth.</p>
            <p n="3">2. The peculiar bleſſing and aſſiſtance of Gods good ſpirit, which always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies a truly religious man to guide him into all truth which is neceſſary for him.</p>
            <p>I will begin with the former, and ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that the practice of religious Duties hath a natural efficacy upon the mind, to clear its diſcerning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42893:50"/>
to make it capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and giving a full aſſent to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. And this I ſhall make appear by inſtancing in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duties, which are of a natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which no man can be ignorant of; each of which, ſingly conſidered, hath a very immediate influence upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to make it capable of divine knowledge. In conſideration of which it will alſo appear, that the contrary vices to theſe are the onely cauſes of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and damnable errors. The Duties I ſhall particularly inſiſt on, are theſe:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Simplicity of mind without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</item>
               <item>2. Purity of heart and affections.</item>
               <item>3. Humility.</item>
               <item>4. Calmneſs of Temper.</item>
               <item>5. Prayer to God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are all Duties of a natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and therefore he that comes to examin the truth of the Goſpel cannot be preſumed ignorant of, nor unwilling to practiſe them if he ſeek for knowledge with that preparation I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that examines the doctrine of the Goſpel with this intention, to ſatisfie his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42893:51"/>
conſcience concerning thoſe things that are neceſſary for him to believe and do, reſolving by Gods grace, to do the will of God, as far as it ſhal be made known to him; ſuch a one will bring with him an honeſt ſimplicity of mind, not biaſſed by prejudice or preconceived opinions; ſuch a one will conſider with himſelf, that the truth of things doth not depend upon his own fancy, or petty reaſonings; that a ſtrong imagination cannot make thoſe things Articles of Faith, which God hath not revealed; and therefore he will bring with him no preconceived opinion, which he will not be ready to lay aſide upon ſufficient evidence to the contrary; he will not endeavour to diſtort, and wreſt the plain words of Scripture to that ſenſe of things which he formerly had; but will readily yield up all his former no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the authority of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That we are naturally obliged to this ſimplicity of judgment in all enquiries after truth, is evident; becauſe in all manner of diſputes, this is one of the firſt things we challenge from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, as our undoubted right, that he would hear what we have to ſay, without prejudice; and therefore we alſo ought to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42893:51"/>
bring with us to a religious debate, the ſame free and unprejudiced minds which we expect from others. And indeed this temper of mind is highly neceſſary, and very advantageous to prepare us for the reception of truth. For certainly the power of prejudice is very great, to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mens minds, and to mould them into ſuch apprehenſions as are moſt ſuitable to it. And therefore it is eaſie to obſerve how men who are engaged in a Party, and prepoſſeſſed with the diſtinguiſhing opinions of their Sect, eaſily find ways to pervert the plaineſt places of Scripture to their own ſenſe, to make it agree with the Analogy of their Faith, that is, of their darling Notions. When I ſpeak of laying aſide prejudice in the ſearch after divine truth, I do not underſtand that we muſt call in queſtion all kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceptions we have had concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters. Some things there are in Religion of ſo great certainty and evidence, that though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach us otherwiſe, we ought not to receive him. Such are thoſe preconceptions we have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Being and Attributes of God, that he is moſt wiſe, juſt, powerful, faithful,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42893:52"/>
and true, &amp;c. Such alſo are the general notions of good and evil which God hath planted in every mans ſoul; which have ſo evident an obligation, that no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded demonſtration in the World ought to ſhake our belief of them. But there are other opinions which men take up upon leſſer evidence, which they are ſometimes as tenacious of, as of thoſe firſt fundamental principles. And theſe ſort of prejudices are commonly the great hindrances of the propagation of truth, there being ſcarcely any Sect in Religion which have not ſome peculiar tenets, which they take up upon weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent grounds, in proportion to which, they judge of all other doctrines, and make them the rule and meaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which all places of Scripture muſt be interpreted. Now in regard we all confeſs our ſelves liable to infirmity and miſtake, it is certainly the moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and reaſonable thing in the World, that when we come to enquire after truth, we reſolve with our ſelves always to ſubmit to clear evidence, though we have been otherwiſe perſuaded. Now that the want of this temper is a very great hindrance both to the receiving the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42893:52"/>
Goſpel, and to our underſtanding it aright when we have received it, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove by two notorious inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the power of prejudice in either of theſe caſes.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance ſhall be that of the Jews in our Saviours days. The great oppoſition which our Saviour met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all among the Jews, the great reaſon why they would not receive him for their Meſſias, was grounded upon this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that they took it for granted that their long expected Meſſias was to have been a temporal Prince, and to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with worldly pomp and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and that he ſhould have delivered them from the Roman Yoke, and have reigned gloriouſly in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore when they ſaw him appear in ſo mean and deſpicable a condition, not all the demonſtrations of a divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority accompanying him in all his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work, not the greateſt wiſdom with which he ſpake, not the moſt divine and excellent precepts he gave, not all the predictions of their Prophets fulfilled by him, not any of theſe things, though they were in themſelves as great evidence as they could have required, yet none of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42893:53"/>
them could prevail with them againſt that one prejudice, that his Power was to be temporal, and that he ſhould <hi>reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael</hi> in a literal ſenſe; which was inconſiſtent with that ſtate of ſufferings in which our Saviour appeared. Now that this Opinion of the Jews was taken up upon inſufficient grounds is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence; becauſe though there are glorious things ſpoken of the Meſſias, yet his ſufferings alſo are foretold by the ſame Prophets in as plain words as the other. Nay, it is expreſly ſaid by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that the glory that ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Meſſias, was to be conſequent upon his ſufferings, as a reward of them. And the Jews themſelves have been ſo far ſenſible of the force of thoſe predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to prove that the Meſſias ſhould ſuffer, that to ſalve thoſe prophecies they invented a Fable concerning a two-fold Meſſias; one of which was to ſuffer for them, and the other to redeem them, and to reign gloriouſly over them. Though the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah ch.</hi> liij. <hi>v.</hi> 12. expreſly attributes both to the ſame perſon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſuffering of the Meſſias the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the glory which God would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confer on him. <hi>Therefore will I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42893:53"/>
               <hi>him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> &amp;c. But the minds of the Jews were ſtrongly affected with the love of this preſent World, and the glory of it; and they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that in the days of the Meſſias they ſhould plentifully enjoy all the bleſſings of this life; and therefore they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to believe no more of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets than agreed with this opinion, that was ſo ſuitable to their inclinations, and were uncapable of being convinced by the moſt powerful demonſtration to the contrary, that could poſſibly be given. Thus we ſee how great the power of this one prejudice was, to hinder the Jews from receiving the Goſpel at firſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is the power of preconceived opinions and prejudices leſs dangerous to hinder our underſtanding the Goſpel, when we have received it. And of this I might produce many inſtances in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſſenting Parties in Chriſtendom; every Sect having ſome peculiar and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Notion, which they hold tenaciouſly againſt all oppoſition; and to comply with which, all other doctrines muſt be bowed and wreſted, as they can beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42893:54"/>
it. I ſhall give but one inſtance of this kind, and that is the doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, as it is maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is the leading prejudice of that Party, which being once firmly received, it becomes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the moſt abſurd and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious opinions in the World: and which is worſt of all, makes thoſe who believe it, uncapable of conviction by any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though never ſo clear and cogent. For what argument can poſſibly prevail with thoſe who reſolve to reject the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their ſenſes, though never ſo well qualified, rather than call in queſtion the infallible deciſion of their Church. And this the Papiſts plainly do in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which hath ſo many plain abſurdities in it, and is ſo clearly contradicted by our ſeveral ſenſes that are capable of judging in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there can be no other reaſon of their obſtinate defending of it, but that they cannot renounce the doctrine without quitting their claim to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It is beſide my preſent buſineſs to conſider upon what grounds they build that infallible power of their Church, in determining matters of Faith; but yet
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42893:54"/>
methinks I cannot perſuade my ſelf that they have any Argument for it ſo plain and cogent as the teſtimony of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore it cannot but ſeem a ſtrange way of arguing which they uſe, to deny matter of fact evident to their ſeveral ſenſes, to maintain a doctrine for which they have infinitely leſs evidence than that they reject. We ſee then how far preconceived opinions and prejudices may prevail, both to make men uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving the Goſpel, and of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it rightly, when they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and conſequently how much this ſimplicity of mind doth contribute to our ſucceſs in the enquiries we make after divine truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond branch of duty, which doth highly conduce to our receiving the Goſpel, and underſtanding it aright, is purity of heart; which conſiſts chiefly in the moderation of our ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and pleaſures. He that intends to do the will of God, muſt not retain in his boſom any luſt or habitual inclination, which he is not willing to forego, if he find it contradictory to his will, whom he reſolves to obey; and for that reaſon muſt have a conſtant watch over his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42893:55"/>
deſires, to keep them in their due bounds. Thoſe natural appetites which every man is endued with, which tend to the preſervation of life, and the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, are in themſelves the work of God, and are deſigned by him for good ends; and we may lawfully gratifie them ſo far as is requiſite for the accompliſhment of thoſe ends. But this is one of the greateſt trials of our prudence and reſolution in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives, to underſtand the true bounds, how far we may lawfully indulge the lower faculties, and to reſtthere: for if our Reaſon, which ſhould prefide over them, once let go the reins, by which ſhe ſhould govern and reſtrain them, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily get the maſtery, and are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their juſt meaſures without great difficulty and reluctancy. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating theſe deſires I conceive to be that which our Saviour recommends to us S. <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 8. as a means to attain to the beatifical viſion of God, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Which bleſſing, though it principally be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the bliſsful ſight or knowledge of God in the Kingdom of Heaven; yet hath it part of its accompliſhment in this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42893:55"/>
life. The pure in heart being the beſt qualified to judge of thoſe divine and ſpiritual things which God hath made known to us in the Goſpel. And this will eaſily appear, if we conſider how much the contrary Vices tend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching the Underſtanding in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The fumes of Luſt and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are very pernicious to our rational powers; they make men dull and of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding even in the ordinary affairs of life: and then ſurely, if they make men unfit for worldly buſineſs, they will render them infinitely more uncapable of religious enquiries. A man who is led captive by his impure deſires, will not eaſily be brought to ſpend ſo much time to enquire ſeriouſly into the nature of Religion, as is neceſſary for his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; he is afraid he ſhould be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſomething that would ruffle and diſcompoſe his thoughts, awaken his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and put a check to his Carreer of pleaſure; and therefore, while he can find pretences to defer his enquiry, he will. But then ſuppoſe a man of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould for once undertake to peruſe the Goſpel, yet being prepoſſeſſed with the love of theſe ſenſual delights, he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42893:56"/>
would find out many Arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf withal; many arts and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to juſtifie, or at leaſt to palliate and excuſe his practice; and then withall it is certain, he would not have a due reliſh of the excellency of thoſe precepts which the Goſpel gives, nor of the rewards it promiſes, they being of a more refined and ſpiritual nature, and of a kind ſo vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from what he is moſt deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ij. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> To this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart I have been ſpeaking of, may be reduced a generous contempt of the World, a freedom from all covetous and ambitious deſires; for he that hath his heart ſet upon riches, or upon the pomps and gallantries of the World, is not in any capacity of receiving or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel. Theſe two Vices, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Ambition, have even from the Apoſtles times been noted for the great cauſes of Infidelity and Hereſie. The love of Money was that, which made the young man in our Saviours time go away ſorrowful; becauſe he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42893:56"/>
could not be admitted a Diſciple of our Saviour without relinquiſhing his large poſſeſſions. This was the cauſe of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>'s Apoſtaſie from the Religion he once embraced, becauſe he loved the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> is noted by S. <hi>John</hi> for his ambition; for he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Apoſtle, loving to have the pre-eminence. S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo puts theſe two cauſes together, Pride and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, as the principal reaſons of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and falſe doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vj. 3. <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine, which is according to godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words; ſuppoſing that gain is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> And indeed it is eaſie to obſerve how hard it is to convince any man of what is contrary to his intereſt or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſires; and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but underſtand, that this duty of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, which conſiſts in regulating our worldly and ſenſual affections, highly conduces to the underſtanding and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Goſpel; becauſe it takes away thoſe dangerous cauſes of Errour and Apoſtaſie.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42893:57"/>
3. A third branch of Duty, which I propoſed to treat of, as being a neceſſary qualification for all Enquirers after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, is Humility, and the efficacy of this duty to make us capable of divine impreſſions will appear, if we conſider theſe properties of an humble and modeſt man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that is truly humble, and ſenſible of his many defects and infirmities, will readily acknowledge that he is not able to underſtand all Myſteries. He knows the nature of God which is infinite, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comprehended by his finite and narrow faculties. He knows that no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of ours can give us ſo true an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Nature and Attributes of God, and of the various methods of his providence towards men, as God himſelf can; and therefore he doth with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſubmit his underſtanding to thoſe revelations which God hath made in the Goſpel; and provided they be there plainly delivered, he will not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from his belief of them, by any of thoſe imperfect reaſonings, wherewith men of corrupt minds may endeavour to ſhake his Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A truly humble man will not be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42893:57"/>
too curious and inquiſitive in praying into thoſe things which are not clearly revealed; much leſs will he be poſitive and dogmatical concerning them. This vertue of humility will lead him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that had the knowledge of ſuch and ſuch controverted doctrines been neceſſary for him, they would have been delivered in Scripture with the ſame plainneſs as other things of the greateſt importance are; he will ſatisfie himſelf, that God was able to have interpreted his mind to the World as far as he thought convenient; and therefore where God hath not uſed this plaineſs, he thinks it a ſufficient check to his curioſity, and that he ought not to pry into it. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> xxix. 29. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us and to our children for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. An humble man is naturally apt to learn; he is willing to be inſtructed, he will eaſily believe that ſome other men may have better abilities to underſtand and judge of truth than himſelf; eſpecially he will have a great deference and regard to his ſpiritual Guides, who are ſet over him for his inſtruction in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42893:58"/>
he will conſider that theſe men are commiſſioned by God, and have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar promiſe of the divine Spirit, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them in the diſcharge of their holy Office; and therefore that they ought to be attended to with ſuch reverence, as is due to the Ambaſſadors of God, to the interpreters of his mind and will. Not that the truly humble man is bound to yield a blind aſſent to whatever he hears delivered from a Pulpit, or that he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to renounce his own reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whenever it is contradicted by his immediate Paſtor. No, we do not claim this dominion over the reaſon and conſciences of our brethren. We do not require an abſolute aſſent to all we ſay: onely thus much an humble man will, and ought to think his duty, not to oppoſe every private ſcruple of his own, to the received doctrine of the Church in which he lives; much leſs to ſeparate from it without manifeſt and plain grounds. He ought rather to diſtruſt his own private judgment, when it ſtands in competition with the publick ſenſe of the Church; and to uſe all poſſible diligence for further information, before he be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in his opinion. He ought to apply
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42893:58"/>
himſelf with all humility to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to deſire ſatisfaction from them, and he ought to attend to them with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ſubmiſſion, and to be very cautious, leſt any prejudice or ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould be the ground of his perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and then if after a due diligence he find himſelf ſtill unconvinced, yet ſtill humility will oblige him not to judge thoſe who differ from him, nor to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf from the publick ſervice of God, as long as there is nothing required of him as a condition of Communion, which he is not fully convinced to be be unlawful. Now he that proceds with this humility and deliberation in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of thoſe doctrines of the Church which ſeem doubtful to him. This hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper will either lead him to the means of ſatisfaction from the inſtruction of his Superiours, or at leaſt will ſecure him from the danger and malignity of his Errour. For ſimple Errour is not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in it ſelf, unleſs it ariſe from a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable cauſe; or unleſs it lead to ſin or diſobedience. And this an humble man will hardly be tempted to for the ſake of any private Opinion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An humble and modeſt man will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42893:59"/>
be willing to yield to ſuch Arguments as the matter he enquires about is capable of; and will not require greater evidence for revealed truths than the nature of the things will admit of.</p>
            <p>And indeed the want of this temper of mind may juſtly be accounted the fundamental Principle of Atheiſm and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion. Many diſputers there are in the World, who think it an Argument of Wit and Parts, to be able to defend a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, and to ſtand their ground againſt all oppoſition. Theſe men ſeek not Truth, but Victory; and do not ſo much endeavour to ſatisfie themſelves, as to amuſe others: and therefore as long as they are able to raiſe an Objection which they think their Adverſary cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they take it for granted that it is unanſwerable; and think that a ſufficient reaſon to deny the force of all poſitive Arguments whatſoever<hi>:</hi> Now this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and conceited way of diſputing, renders men very unfit to enquire after truth in any kind of Science, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Religion: for the doctrine of the Goſpel is not capable of ſuch proofs, but that a perverſe and unteachable Spirit may find ſome kind of evaſions, to abate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42893:59"/>
the force of them; and may raiſe ſome kind of groundleſs ſuſpicion, that poſſibly things might have been otherwiſe than they are there repreſented. The evidence of Chriſtian Religion in theſe days doth in great meaſure depend upon the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth of thoſe relations of matters of fact, which were done by our Saviour, and his Apoſtles in confirmation of the doctrine they taught; and the truth of thoſe things is atteſted by as credible witneſſes, as any matter of fact ever was; and matters of fact are not capable of any other or better proof than the teſtimony of thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of them. But yet ſtill a man that were perverſe and obſtinate might ſay, that the evidence of ſenſe is more convincing than that of witneſſes. That ſeeing is believing; and if I could ſee ſome of thoſe ſigns and wonders wrought now, which are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have been done in our Saviours time, I would believe. But as for theſe Hiſtorical narrations, if either the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them were themſelves decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or did intend to deceive or delude poſterity, neither of which is abſolutely impoſſible; if either of theſe things ſhould have been, thoſe relations are no evidence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42893:60"/>
at all. Now although it be the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and unreaſonable thing in the world to ſuppoſe, that ſo many thouſands of the Primitive Chriſtians ſhould lay down their lives ſo cheerfully in teſtimony of the truth of the Goſpel, without being ſatisfied about it themſelves, or with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to deceive others. Though this be the abſurdeſt thing in the world, yet if any man will be ſo perverſe as to think ſo of the Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians, what further Argument can be uſed to convince him? For what further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can we expect of any mans ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in what he ſaith, than that he will lay down his life to atteſt it, as they did? And then for their knowledge in theſe things, we may well appeal to the divine wiſdom, wherewith they ſpake and wrote, that ſuch men could not be deceived in the plaineſt matters. Yet ſtill the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians is not ſo great evidence, as that of ſenſe; though it be as great as the nature of the thing is capable of. And therefore a man that is reſolved to yield to nothing but ſenſible demonſtration, muſt expect to go away unſatisfied, as to the truth of the Goſpel, becauſe it is not now capable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42893:60"/>
of that kind of evidence. But now an humble Enquirer after truth, that ſought for knowledge in order to practice, ſuch a one would not be thus obſtinate and refractory in his proceedings: He would content himſelf with ſuch evidence as the things he enquires about are capable of, and will require no greater. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that thoſe perverſe diſputers, who are not content with that rational evidence we have for the truth of the Goſpel, would not be convinced, though they ſaw a miracle. For our Saviour hath plainly told us in a like caſe, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they believe though one ariſe unto them from the dead.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was at firſt confirmed to the Jews by miracles, but afterwards they were to be content with the teſtimony of their Fathers concerning it, and thoſe who would not believe the doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon that evidence, according to our Saviours judgment, would not be convinced by the greateſt miracle, even the reſurrection of one from the dead. The caſe is now the ſame with us, as it was with the Jews in our Saviours time. At the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42893:61"/>
it was confirmed from Heaven by ſuch ſigns and wonders, and mighty works, which could not have been wrought but by the almighty power of God, atteſting the truth of what our Saviour and his Apoſtles taught. But the doctrine of the Goſpel being once ſufficiently confirmed, God expects now that man ſhould reſt ſatisfied with that evidence which he then gave; and is conveyed down to us by the teſtimony of thoſe, who were witneſſes of thoſe miracles and mighty works with which it was then atteſted. Nor is it to be expected that God ſhould now work miracles to convince the obſtinate, ſince the evidence he hath already given is ſufficient for thoſe who are humble and teachable, and will render the obſtinate inexcuſable. Men may therefore, if they pleaſe, diſpute themſelves out of their Religion upon I know not what vain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſet up for Wits, and men of more than ordinary reach, not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on by any Hiſtorical Narrations, though never ſo well atteſted; but in the end they will find how far this perverſe and arrogant humour falls ſhort of true wiſdom: when for the ſake of that they reject the divine and heavenly doctrine,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42893:61"/>
which if carefully attended to and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, is able to ſave their ſouls. By what hath been ſaid it is eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how neceſſary a qualification humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is, in order to our enquiry after truth, and how effectual it is to make us fit for the reception of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth branch of duty very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to us, to make us capable of divine knowledge, is calmneſs of temper and moderation of paſſions. He that comes to enquire after truth, muſt bring with him a quiet and ſedate temper; he muſt be willing to hear patiently what can be ſaid on both ſides, and by no means engage his paſſion on either part, till he hath firſt ſatisfied his Reaſon about it. Our paſſions are then very uſeful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to us, when they promote our vigour in the proſecution of things that are vertuous and praiſe-worthy, and when they encourage us to make a bold reſiſtance againſt all things that are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unworthy of us; but then, that we may be aſſured that our paſſion is duely exerciſed, it is neceſſary that our reaſon ſhould have firſt throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the matter, and given in its impartial ſentence, before we ſuffer our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42893:62"/>
paſſions to interpoſe in our examination of truth. For when once our affections are engaged on any ſide, they do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biaſs the judgment and make it admit of every ſmall appearance or ſhadow of truth, which ſeems to favour the opinion we have a fanſie for, and to reject with diſdain the ſtrongeſt reaſonings, when they are oppoſed to what we deſire ſhould be true. Men do not then ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſeek for truth, but endeavour to prove that true which they have a mind to; and though they happen to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they will not then endure to be better informed, and are impatient of any contradiction. And this is accounted one great reaſon, why among ſo many Writers of Controverſie ſo few have ever changed the opinions they at firſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or have yielded the cauſe, when they have been fairly and fully anſwered<hi>:</hi> Alas! it is hard for them to renounce thoſe beloved notions which had been impreſſed on their minds in their younger years, and they had rather take hold of any ſhift or evaſion, then grant they had been in an errour. But if they find their own reaſon begin to waver, being in part convinced by the force of contrary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42893:62"/>
they fly for refuge to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of others, and fortifie themſelves with this conſideration, that ſuch and ſuch men are men of noted learning and piety, and yet they are all of this opinion; and yet doubtleſs they underſtood the force of thoſe arguments better than we do, and would have yielded to them, had they thought them convincing. Thus when Reaſon of it ſelf would yield, yet their affection to the cauſe, and the men that maintain it makes them hold out ſtill; and though they have a glimpſe of truth, they dare not, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p>But the paſſion I intended principally to ſpeak of, as being a great hindrance to our receiving the Truth, is that of Anger; which is a boiſterous, unruly paſſion, and diſorders all the powers of the reaſonable ſoul, and makes them wholly unfit for any impreſſions of truth. A man that is angry and impatient, will not allow his Adverſary leave to ſpeak out half an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but preſently he is provoked, and then he is not able to make a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable defence though he ſhould have the truth on his ſide, he doth not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is moſt fit and proper to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42893:63"/>
ſaid, but caſts out at random what his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion firſt ſuggeſts to him: all his thoughts are then in commotion, and like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waves, will not receive any perfect image of things, and you may as well hope to convince a mad man as him.</p>
            <p>Now this heat of paſſion, as it makes men very unfit to be wrought upon by others, ſo it commonly ſuggeſts to us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improper ways of arguing, when we endeavour to convince them who differ from us. This temper of mind produces thoſe ſharp and ſatyrical Treatiſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome men endeavour, if not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, yet to ſhame and ſilence their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, by expoſing their perſons, and repreſenting them to the World under odious Characters. Now certainly what ever theſe men may hope, this method of railing and reviling, though the perſons they accuſe may really deſerve all that is ſaid of them, yet I ſay, this is not a fit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the propagation of truth. For as the piety of one man ought to be no defence or ſecurity for his errour; ſo neither ought it to be any argument againſt the truth, that it is defended by a bad man: and therefore all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are levelled againſt the perſon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42893:63"/>
of our Adverſary, are wholly beſides the purpoſe; they tend onely to the breach of Charity, not to the convincing any mans judgement that differs from us. And certainly our bleſſed Savior, when he gave us ſo many precepts of meekneſs and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards all men, when he ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us not to judge and condemn our brethren, over whom we have no juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, when he repreſents to us the danger of uncharitable ſpeeches, S. <hi>Matt.</hi> v. 22. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, Raca, ſhall be in danger of the council; and whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell-fire.</hi> When our Saviour ſo often inculcates theſe and the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, requiring ſo humble and charitable demeanour towards our brethren both in thoughts &amp; words; he cannot be ſuppoſed to give the leaſt permiſſion to his Diſciples to endeavour to propagate or defend any part of his doctrine by reproachful and contumelious uſage of the perſons they contend with. Sure I am, his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was infinitely different from what men practiſe in theſe days. Our Saviour had certainly more clear right on his ſide, than any man can now pretend to, but was entertained with the greateſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42893:64"/>
of ſinners that can be imagined; and if any injury might juſtly provoke our rage and paſſion, thoſe offered to our Saviour were of the moſt hainous and provoking nature; but yet, <hi>when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he threatned not; he rendered not evil for evil, nor railing for railing; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly.</hi> And now can any man pretend to own the obligation of our Saviours precepts and example, and yet contend for the truth of his doctrine with ſo much bitterneſs and virulency of ſpeech towards their diſſenting brethren, as ſome of our zealous Diſputants do in theſe days. S. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us that <hi>Michael the Archangel, when he contended with the Devil, he durſt not bring againſt him a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling accuſation:</hi> and how then can we preſume to do it in our Religious debates with our Chriſtian brethren, who for ought we know, notwithſtanding our miſconceptions of them, may be in truth the children of God, though fallen into errour. In a word, to conclude this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he that would learn, muſt be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be contradicted, and hear with patience what may be ſaid, be it never ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42893:64"/>
oppoſite to his former notions, or to his preſent wiſhes. Otherwiſe he will be hardly capable to judge aright. Again, he that would inſtruct and convince others, muſt do it alſo with calmneſs of ſpirit, confuting errour with all the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſpicuity he is able, but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the perſons he endeavours to reform. For if by reproach and contumely he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their paſſion, whom he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, he deſtroys the force of all his reaſoning by diſcompoſing thoſe faculties which ſhould judge of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth point of duty which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeak of, as having great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our underſtanding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Goſpel, is Prayer to God. This is a duty of natural obligation, as may appear by the many precepts of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers concerning it. <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> in particular adviſes to undertake no work, to endeavour nothing without imploring the divine aſſiſtance. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This he ſubjoins to many other precepts of Vertue, as the complement and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them. And ſurely if the implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the divine aſſiſtance is neceſſary in all our concerns, it is principally to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42893:65"/>
regarded in our ſearch of divine Truth. For to whom ſhoud we ſeek for knowledg but to him who is the Fountain of Truth, the Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect gift comes. And the ſame Philoſopher immediately after his precepts of Vertue, and his direction to pray to God to bleſs and perfect our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, he adds this, as the firſt and principal benefit that would redound to us thereby, that we ſhould by ſo doing gain the knowledge both of the divine and humane nature; which is not much different from what I have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Vertue hath in it ſelf a natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to clear the underſtanding, and make it capable of divine knowledge; and ſurely if Philoſophers by the force of natural principles, underſtood the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity we had of the divine aſſiſtance in all our endeavours, and that Prayer was the means by which it was to be ſought, we who have received better means of inſtruction than they had, cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this point of duty: eſpecially the doctrine of the Goſpel being ſo full of precepts of this kind, requiring us to pray to God in all our exigencies, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42893:65"/>
aſſuring us of ſucceſs by ſo doing, if we be not wanting to our ſelves. Thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 9. our Saviour adviſes us, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you.</hi> And then follows, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> And S. <hi>James</hi> yet more nearly to our preſent purpoſe directs us to make our humble addreſſes to God in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divine knowledge. <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men plenteouſly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have thus far inſiſted on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular duties, each of which ſingly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, hath a very great efficacy to enable us to underſtand thoſe truths which are revealed in the Goſpel; and to make us capable of ſatisfaction concerning them. From whence the inference will be eaſie and obvious, that if the practice of each of theſe be very uſeful, and beneficial to us in our ſearch after knowledge; then ſurely where theſe are all united, they cannot ordinarily fail of their deſired effect. But yet we are to conſider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the condition which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42893:66"/>
here requires, is not compleated in our obſervance of thoſe particular duties above-mentioned; but in an univerſal and impartial obedience to the Will of God, as far as it is already known to us, and in a ſincere reſolution to obey him in all further revelations of his Will, which upon peruſal of the Goſpel, we ſhall find to be our duty. And a man thus qualified, beſides the natural effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Vertue to make him fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Goſpel, hath moreover a peculiar promiſe of the divine bleſſing and aſſiſtance to enlighten his mind, and to guide him into all neceſſary truth. And this is the ſecond account upon which we may be aſſured of the truth of our Saviours propoſition, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God, who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, will not be wanting to any, who ſeek for truth with a ſincere reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſubmit to it: eſpecially to thoſe who have already exerciſed themſelves in doing his will according to their knowledge, he will not fail to afford
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42893:66"/>
ſuch further means of inſtruction as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them, according to what our Saviour ſaith in the parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 29. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every man that hath,</hi> that is, who maketh a due uſe of what he hath, <hi>to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi> Every one who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavours to live up to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge he hath, God will give to him ſuch further degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as ſhall be ſuitable and neceſſary for him; and of this we have a great ſignal example in <hi>Cornelius</hi> the good Centurion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>whoſe Prayers</hi> and <hi>Alms,</hi> while he was a ſtranger to Chriſts Religion, were ſo far accepted by God, that he was pleaſed miraculouſly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to <hi>Peter</hi> for further inſtruction what he ought to do.</p>
            <p>Now although we are not to expect that all ſincere Enquirers after Truth ſhall be thus miraculouſly inſtructed, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was; yet God hath given us abundant aſſurance, that no ſuch perſon ſhall miſcarry for want of neceſſary knowledge. For to this end God hath given his Holy Spirit, to continue with his Church to the end of the World, to guide it into all neceſſary truth, and to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42893:67"/>
aſſiſt and govern every lively member of Chriſts body in the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all that is indiſpenſably requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him. God himſelf hath a ſingular delight and pleaſure in good men, as the holy Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxlvij. II. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, and in them that hope in his mercy:</hi> and our Saviour aſſures us, that God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to <hi>dwell and inhabit</hi> with ſuch perſons; which I conceive cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in any other ſenſe, than that there is a very near intercourſe between God and good men, that God is always ready to aſſiſt and ſuccour them in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they call upon him for. <hi>John</hi> xiv. 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And then ſurely being bleſt with the preſence of ſuch a Gueſt, they cannot want any meaſure of knowledge in the ways of God, that is neceſſary for them.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, what remains now, but if we deſire knowledge and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Religion we profeſs, that we apply our ſelves to ſeek it in this way which our Saviour hath preſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſincere reſolutions and endeavours
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42893:67"/>
to do the will of God according to our knowledge. This is the onely way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by true knowledge is to be obtained, he that ſeeks in this way ſhall not miſcarry. For <hi>if any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>

            <p>IN the former Chapter of this Epiſtle the Apoſtle given us a large account of the afflictions and ſufferings of thoſe Patriarchs and Prophets, and other holy men, who lived before the coming of our Saviour; and the words I have now read are an inference from their example, that we alſo having before
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42893:69"/>
our eyes the glorious things which they did and ſuffered, and calling to mind the mighty power and efficacy of their Faith in overcoming the World and enduring afflictions, may from thence be excited to a like vigour and conſtancy in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion. So that the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe two things worthy our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: An Exhortation, and the reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>The Exhortation in theſe words;</p>
            <q>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race which is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</q>
            <p>The reaſon of the Exhortation in theſe words:</p>
            <q>Seeing we are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes.</q>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more uſual in holy Scripture, than to repreſent the duty of a Chriſtian under the ſimilitude of ſuch other imployments, as carry with them the greateſt difficulties, and require the moſt exact care and vigilance in thoſe who
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42893:69"/>
undertake them. Sometimes we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Soldiers, who muſt be always upon the Guard: ſometimes to Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Pilgrims, who have a long and hazardous journey to make: ſometimes to thoſe who ſtrive for Maſteries in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Games. Now theſe ſeveral ſorts of imployments do all preſuppoſe theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That thoſe who undertake them do propoſe to themſelves ſome great and conſiderable end, ſome reward of their labours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there are great difficulties to be paſſed through, great induſtry, and care, and watchfulneſs to be uſed for the attainment of it.</p>
            <p>The caſe is not unlike in our Chriſtian Profeſſion. We have a glorious prize of our high Calling ſet before us; we have an exceeding great reward, a Crown of Glory laid up for us, which God the righteous Judge and juſt Rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him, will not fail to beſtow on ſuch as overcome. But then we muſt not expect this Reward and Crown upon any other condition, than that we approve our ſelves as men who have fought the good fight of Faith man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42893:70"/>
and couragiouſly; who have ſtrove lawfully and endured to the end. The ſimilitude uſed in the Text is taken from thoſe Trials of Skill, thoſe publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes which were uſed in the Olympick Games. Now for thoſe who run in a Race, there are three things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done, if they hope to gain the victory: in proportion to which the whole duty of a Chriſtian is expreſſed in this Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They muſt free themſelves from all unneceſſary burdens, from all their looſe garments which may clog or entangle them in their way; they muſt <hi>lay away every weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt be active and vigorous in the courſe; they muſt <hi>run the race ſet before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt continue their vigour and courage to the end of the race. This I conceive to be meant by <hi>running with patience,</hi> that is, with perſeverance and continuance in well-doing. Now it is eaſie to apply theſe ſeveral circumſtances to our Chriſtian duty, and I ſhall conſider each of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is eaſie to underſtand, that what is here metaphorically expreſſed, by <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42893:70"/>
               <hi>aſide every weight,</hi> is the ſame with what S. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere teaches us in plain terms, and calls the <hi>denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and what our Saviour means by <hi>denying our ſelves.</hi> The riches, honours, and pleaſures of the World, and the love of them, which S. <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye,</hi> and <hi>the pride of life,</hi> are not unfitly compared to ſo many clogs and weights that preſs down the ſoul, and are apt to make it dull and unactive, and divert it from the ways of holineſs: and the laying aſide theſe incumbrances, the freeing our minds from theſe affections and deſires, and from the love of all things elſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; nay, of our life it ſelf when it ſtands in competition with our duty, is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a preparation for our running the race ſet before us, that without ſo doing we are not capable of being Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> xvj. 24. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto his Diſciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me.</hi> S. <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 38. <hi>He that taketh not his croſs, and followeth after me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me.</hi> Now that the renouncing and forſaking our carnal luſts and deſires is moſt generally to be underſtood by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

up the croſs, and denying our ſelves, I conceive evident from hence; becauſe it is made a neceſſary qualification of all that will be Chriſts Diſciples, not onely thoſe who ſuffer perſecutions, but all that will be Chriſtians muſt in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion deny themſelves, and take up the Croſs. Theſe and the like expreſſions are univerſal, not limited to any time or place, or other circumſtances, but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to all Chriſtians, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and ſiſter, yea and his own life alſo, cannot be my Diſciple: and whoſoever doth not bear his croſs, and follow me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi> Now the hating theſe things in the literal ſenſe can then onely be our duty, when the love of them is inconſiſtent with our profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; for otherwiſe they ought to be moſt dear to us: but this is a caſe which very ſeldom happens. The taking up the Croſs therefore, and denying our ſelves which is required of all Chriſtians, muſt be interpreted of laying aſide our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular luſts and deſires: which is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this interpretation, called <hi>crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh with its affections and luſts;</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:42893:71"/>
and is expreſſed in the Text, by <hi>laying aſide every weight:</hi> nay poſſibly if it were not beſide my preſent deſign, it would be no difficult task to make it appear, that denying our ſelves, and taking up the Croſs, in this ſenſe I am ſpeaking, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and ſubduing our fleſhly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, the freeing our minds from evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and inclinations, and from the darling ſins we have delighted in, may be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trial of our obedience and love to God, and our deſire to pleaſe him, than even the laying down our lives for the teſtimony of the truth of the Goſpel. Many men can be prodigal of life, and die with great bravery and reſolution, when they would think it a very hard and laborious imployment to endure the ſeverities of mortification; and to wean themſelves from ſome long accuſtomed pleaſure and temptation. But to return to the buſineſs in hand, <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not pretend to give a Catalogue of thoſe particular luſts and deſires, which by the force of this Exhortation we are to forſake and lay aſide. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of them is infinite, according to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42893:72"/>
ſeveral ways of living men are engaged in, according to the difference of their temper and conſtitution, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumſtances. I ſhall onely take notice of two general rules in this matter, which the Text ſuggeſts to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our care in this affair be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and impartial: that according to our knowledge and ability we <hi>lay aſide every weight.</hi> It is not ſufficient that we abſtain from this or that particular habit of ſin, if at the ſame time we wilfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our ſelves in others. Though a man be able to ſay with the Phariſee, and to ſay truly, that <hi>he is not an extortioner, unjuſt, adulterer,</hi> nor as this and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, whom he may obſerve in his neighbourhood that is worſe than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet all this while he may cheriſh in his boſom other darling luſts, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual practices, which may exclude him from the kingdom of Heaven, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his caution and abſtinence in other things. For alas! a man may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from many kinds of temptation which others are betrayed by, and yet be guilty of no great vertue in ſo doing. For not onely Vertue and Vice, but even ſeveral Vices themſelves are at enmity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42893:72"/>
with, and mutually deſtroy one another; and therefore it is no vertue in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, that he abſtains from profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and luxury; nor is it praiſe-worthy in the prodigal, that his heart is not ſet upon riches. If the Hypocrite give alms to be ſeen of men, if the ambitious man be courteous and affable, though theſe things be the proper matter of Vertue, yet inaſmuch as they proceed not from from any principle of obedience, or love to God, they are no part of that duty and allegiance we owe him, nor will they be accepted by him; nay certainly he that abſtains from ſome kinds of Vice onely to indulge himſelf in the contrary extream, is ſo far from laying aſide thoſe weights which hinder him in his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe, that he rather loads himſelf the heavier, and is ſtill more unfit for ſo great an undertaking; and indeed ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, that we ſhould be impartial in this affair, that we ſhould lay aſide every weight, that unleſs our diligence extend thus far, any ſingle habit of evil that we indulge our ſelves in, is ſufficient to defeat us of our victory, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave us of our Crown and Triumph: becauſe in Gods account he who wilfully
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42893:73"/>
harbours in his boſome any one habitual luſt, which he is not willing to forego for Gods ſake, is as guilty as though he broke all his laws. So S. <hi>James</hi> tells us Chap. 2. v. 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> And he adds the reaſon of it in the next verſe, becauſe the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God is equally concerned in all his laws, and is therefore equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in the wilful breach of one, as of all or any. <hi>For he that ſaid, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he who picks and chooſes the ſins he will forbear, and what not, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his choice not by any reſpect he bears to the will of God, but by his own temper and inclination. For if he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from any one ſin out of pure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Will of God, becauſe God did forbid it, this reaſon would equally hold againſt all kind of tranſgreſſion, becauſe they are all abominable in the ſight of God: nor could we have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to forbear one more than others. Again further, unleſs our care in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs be univerſal and impartial, to lay aſide every weight, to free our minds from all affections and deſires that may
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42893:73"/>
hinder us in our duty, we are not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our own diſpoſe, and are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a fit capacity to render to God that obedience which is due to him, and which he expects from us. He who gave us our being and endued our ſouls with ſo many excellent perfections and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may juſtly expect and require of us that they be entirely devoted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and he hath accordingly declared that he will accept no leſs. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> But this cannot be done, while we cheriſh in our boſom any inordinate deſire, any luſt, or paſſion which claims an intereſt in our affections, a ſhare in our ſervice, <hi>Mat.</hi> vj. 24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters; for either he will hate the one; and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other: we cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> What is there particularly ſaid of the love of riches, is as true of any other habitual inclination to evil which we indulge our ſelves in. If we cannot ſerve God and Mammon, neither can we ſerve God and our Luſts, we cannot ſerve God and our Ambition, we cannot ſerve God and the Devil.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:42893:74"/>
2. Beſides this univerſal care expreſt here, by laying aſide every weight, we have here in the Text another rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſuggeſted to us, which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us yet more fit and expedite for the race ſet before us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we be more particularly careful to arm our ſelves againſt thoſe temptations, to lay aſide thoſe luſts, to which we perceive our ſelves by nature, or cuſtom moſt inclined.</p>
            <p>This I conceive is meant here by <hi>the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi> Every man who gives himſelf the leiſure to examine his own heart impartially, will find that ſome temptations have a great deal more eaſie acceſs to him than others: and our great adverſary the Devil is very diligent and watchful to ſet before us ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and lay ſuch ſnares in our way, which are moſt likely to prevail upon us. The ſins we are naturally inclined to oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times creep upon us inſenſibly, and get poſſeſſion of our hearts before we are well aware of them. Sometimes they diſguiſe themſelves under the pretence of Piety and ſeeming holineſs, and a great zeal againſt the contrary extream. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they plead Nature and Cuſtom for their continuance, that theſe cannot be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42893:74"/>
overcome: ſometimes we have ways to extenuate them, and make them ſeem ſmall and venial; and if men take time to deliberate about parting with them, there is great hazard but they will keep poſſeſſion. So apt are we to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, when we have a mind to it; when our Adverſaries from without have their correſpondents in our own boſom; when we have ſo many treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gueſts, ſo many deceitful Luſts within us, which are ready to betray us, and to yield up our hearts to a ſubtle and powerful enemy. Here then is our greateſt danger; here we muſt exert our greateſt care and vigilance; here we muſt ſhew our courage and reſolution, in throwing off theſe darling and beloved Luſts, the <hi>ſins that do ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi> This is that which our Saviour elſewhere requires of us, when he bids us cut off our right hands, and pluck out our right eyes, when they make us to offend. And thus much for the firſt part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
            <p>Having according to our power laid aſide every weight, having freed our ſelves from our evil habits, and cuſtoms, and from our moſt ſecret and beloved
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42893:75"/>
Luſts, we are not to reſt here. Thus much is required as a preparation to be Chriſts Diſciples; but when we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the number, we muſt then ſet our ſelves upon an active obedience to his Laws. A negative holineſs will not ſerve our turn. We muſt not onely eſchew evil, but we muſt do what good we can in the ſeveral places and ſtations to which God hath called us. They who run in a Race, when they have ſtript themſelves, and laid aſide all unneceſſary weights and incumbrances, have yet the whole Race before them which they muſt run through, if they expect their Crown and Prize: and therefore in proportion to what is required of them, we alſo are exhorted, in the</p>
            <p n="2">2. Second place, <hi>to run the Race ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi> Now the poſitive duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all Chriſtians, anſwer to that part of the ſimilitude, and to diſcharge them faithfully, is meant by <hi>running the race ſet before us.</hi> And this is elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in plainer Exhortations. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, giving all diligence, add to your faith ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to vertue knowledge, and to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance, and to temperance pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:42893:75"/>
               <hi>and to patience godlineſs, and to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs charity. Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are of good report, if there be any praiſe, or if there be any vertue, think on and do theſe things.</hi> Now theſe and the like Exhortations and Precepts often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in holy Scripture being all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, the particular inſtances of duty required by them, muſt be left to each mans private conſideration; and they are various according to mens ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral abilities and opportunities, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral relations in which God hath placed them. God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath by his wiſe and good providence allotted every man his courſe. It is not of our chooſing, but it is <hi>a race ſet before us.</hi> He hath likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed among men various gifts and abilities, whereby they are ſeverally fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do good; and according to theſe every man muſt judge of his duty in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, what it is that the Lord requires of him; and no man who doth not want will and reſolution to do the will of God,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42893:76"/>
can ordinarily be ignorant what he ought to do; and therefore I ſhall not deſcend to any particular inſtances of duty; only from the ſimilitude here uſed, I ſhall crave leave to ſuggeſt theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That our obedience to God ought to be vigorous and chearful.</item>
               <item>2. That it ought to be conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The ſimilitude of <hi>Running</hi> imports great vigour and alacrity in the diſcharge of our duty. They who run with hopes of Victory muſt not be faint-hearted and languiſh, but muſt be chearful, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, full of hope and eager expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſired triumph. Thus muſt a Chriſtian behave himſelf in the race ſet before him. He muſt go about his duty with chearfulneſs and freedom, as one that doth it with a willing mind, and hopes for ſucceſs by ſo doing. He muſt always have in his eye the great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, the joy ſet before him, the Crown of Glory laid up for him; and in proſpect of that he muſt chearfully undertake whatever difficulties he meets
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42893:76"/>
with in his way. And indeed if we have once obeyed the former part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, if we have once freed our minds from the low and ſordid cares and incumbrances of this life preſent, there can then remain nothing to hinder or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard our motion, or to abate our courage in running the Race ſet before us. And this holy <hi>David</hi> ſeems to expreſs; ſaying, <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou haſt ſet my heart at liberty.</hi> When we are once at liberty from the World, and have weaned our affections from things below, and placed them on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more enduring ſubſtance, then though we meet with dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, we ſhall joyfully go on, and every days progreſs in our courſe of piety will render our task more eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. We ſhall apprehend our ſelves every day more and more, approaching to the end of our hopes, and to the Crown of our labours, and out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſo ſure a reward, ſo nigh at hand; and out of a fore-taſte of that happineſs ſhall be able to ſay of Religion from our own experience, that her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths Peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing repreſented by this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42893:77"/>
ſimilitude of <hi>Running</hi> is, that our courſe of Piety, our religious converſation ought to be conſtant and uninterrupted. He that runs in a Race cannot find leiſure to ſtop and divert himſelf, or ſalute his friends by the way. A little needleſs ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony at ſuch a time, may hazard the loſs of the whole prize. His adverſary perhaps, who was of leſs ability and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, may by ſuch an advantage eaſily get the ſtart of him, and defeat him of the Crown, and he become the deriſion and ſcorn of the beholders. The caſe is not unlike in our Chriſtian Race. It is not ſufficient that we be Religious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout by fits and ſtarts, at ſome ſet time, or upon ſome ſolemn occaſion; but it ought to be our conſtant behaviour, the continued imployment of our lives. The doing the will of God is much more our buſineſs than any other imployment whatſoever; and ought to be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and vigorouſly purſued. For if at any time we give our ſelves leiſure to be idle, and make any leaſt delay or ſtop in our Chriſtian Race, alas we do not conſider how eaſily we may fall ſhort of our deſired end. For how faſt ſoever we go on in our way, our former luſts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42893:77"/>
and deſires we had caſt off, will be ſure to follow us cloſe, to tread in our ſteps, and will watch every opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Parley with us, and entreat our ſtay. And if we once make the leaſt intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to treat with them, it is eaſie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee how ſoon our vigour and heat with which we began the Race, will abate and cool: our joints will then grow ſtiff and unactive, and then preſently a thouſand difficulties ariſe, and we are as far from our Journies end as when we firſt ſet out. So dangerous a thing it is, when we have begun well, and gone on for a while, then to ſtay and look back, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whether we ſhall go farther or not. Nay in theſe caſes of a moral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtay, is to go backward. For ſuch is the nature of man, he cannot be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idle; if he be not engaged in things that are good and vertuous, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be imployed in ſomewhat elſe that is bad and ſinful. And then it is very plain, that a good habit is much more weakened by a little intermiſſion, than it can be ſtrengthened or improved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances of Vertue. So that from theſe conſiderations it may abundantly appear, how neceſſary it is that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42893:78"/>
in this Race before us ſhould be conſtant and uninterrupted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third and laſt part of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is, that our vigour and diligence in this affair muſt be continued to the end of our lives: <hi>We muſt run with patience.</hi> How diligent and active ſoever we may have been in the practice of our duty, how far ſoever we have proceeded in our Chriſtian Race, let no man yet flatter himſelf that he hath done his whole duty, or that he hath attained to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree of perfection he is capable of; or that he is already ſecure of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Crown. For this is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtake, and many who did run once well, may upon this preſumption fooliſhly miſcarry, notwithſtanding all their pains and labour they have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endured. All the promiſes of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward are limited to ſuch as perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in well-doing; and this very ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is a clear evidence of it. For who ever pretended to have won the prize, without running to the end of the Race? Now there is nothing more plain than that our life here is the time of our trial, wherein we muſt work out our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and run the Race ſet before us;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42893:78"/>
and that the life to come is the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or retribution. As long therefore as we live here, we muſt keep up our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in our Chriſtian calling, labouring every day to go on from ſtrength to ſtrength, to grow in grace, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in the practice of all vertue and godlineſs of living. And as for thoſe who imagine to themſelves I know not what ſecurity of their condition, they would do well to remember, that God hath aſſured us that he hath made no ſuch irrevocable decree for any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mans ſalvation, but that he is in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of falling ſhort of it, if he fall from his uprightneſs and integrity. <hi>Ez.</hi> 33. 13. <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the righteous that he ſhall ſurely live, if he truſt to his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and commit iniquity, all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not be remembred. For his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that he hath committed, he ſhall die for it.</hi> Out of a ſenſe of the poſſibility and danger of this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Where the Apoſtle plainly intimates, that they who think themſelves perfect and ſecure of their condition, are in greater danger of falling than others; becauſe that very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42893:79"/>
ſecurity is apt in its own natural tendency to make men ſupine and negligent, and unwilling to proceed further in the Race ſet before them. The truth is, as long as we are in the body, though we have made it our endeavour to throw off eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weight, though we have uſed great diligence in our Chriſtian Race, yet ſtill we have ſomething more to do; we have ſtill many adverſaries to contend with, many temptations to reſiſt; the ſeed of thoſe deſires which we had before, do ſtill remain in us, which will always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford new matter for our vigilance and care. Nor can we ever be ſecure that we have earned our prize till we have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our courſe with patience, and God calls us hence to receive our reward. Sure I am, if any man might be ſecure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand that he had done his whole duty, and was now aſcertained of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, S. <hi>Paul</hi> might pretend as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to that priviledge as any other; but yet he deſcribes his own condition as ſtill imperfect, and ſtill depending upon his future diligence: <hi>Phil.</hi> iij. 12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42893:79"/>
               <hi>of Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thus if we would follow S. <hi>Pauls</hi> example, and the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Text, we muſt ſtill continue preſſing forward, and run with patience to the end of our race.</p>
            <p>Having thus far conſidered the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Text, and the extent of it, I might now endeavour to enforce it by repreſenting to your thoughts the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great reward, the glorious prize we are to run for in the Race ſet before us. Which is ſo great a degree of bleſſedneſs, that neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to conceive of it. I might alſo here recal to your remembrance the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and truth, and goodneſs of God, who hath promiſed this reward, and will beſtow it on thoſe who have endured to the end and run with patience. I might farther add the conſideration of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Gods good Spirit, the great comfort, ſupport and joy which it affords
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42893:80"/>
us in this ſpiritual Race, which infinitely over-ballances all the falſe pleaſures we forſake, and all the difficulties we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in undertaking this enterprize. And laſtly, I might put you in mind of the great danger, reproach, and confuſion of face, which will certainly attend us, if by our negligence and indifference we fall ſhort of this glorious prize; all which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ought to have a mighty influence upon us, to awake and excite our utmoſt induſtry and vigour, to promote our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, and to confirm, ſtrengthen and maintain our courage, conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to go on ſtedfaſtly in the ways of holineſs, and to run with patience the Race ſet before us. But the proſecution of theſe and the like arguments would be too large a ſcope for the time allotted to this exerciſe, and the words of the Text confine my thoughts to a more particular conſideration of the example of the Saints, Martyrs, and holy Confeſſors, who have gone before us in this glorious Race, and have already finiſhed their courſe with patience. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we alſo are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight,</hi> &amp;c. The word <hi>Martyr</hi> or <hi>Witneſs</hi> in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42893:80"/>
ſenſe is uſually reſtrained to ſuch onely, who have laid down their lives in teſtimony of the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but in the language of holy Scripture, I find no ſuch limitation of it. Any of theſe who were either great examples of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and faith in God, any who bare witneſs to divine truth, though they were not called to ſuffer death for that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, being indifferently ſtiled by that name. The Fathers mentioned in the former Chapter cannot all be accounted Martyrs in the ſtricter ſenſe, however they all help to make up the number, which by reaſon of the multitude of them, is here called a Cloud of Witneſſes. Now the force of their witneſs and example to engage us in a like diligence and conſtancy in running the Race ſet before us, I ſhall endeavour to repreſent in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were witneſſes of the truth, and faithfulneſs, and goodneſs of God, in whom we believe; that he is, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him; and therefore that our labour and induſtry in our Chriſtian Race ſhall not be in vain, I mention this truth more particularly, becauſe it ſeems to be the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42893:81"/>
onely Creed, which all the Saints recited in the former Chapter, agreed in. Some of them, 'tis true, had a great proſpect and hope of a Meſſias to come. <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoiced to ſee his day. <hi>Jacobs</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of him is very punctual and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The other Prophets give witneſs to him. But yet it appears not, that all there mentioned had any knowledge at all, either that he was to come, or what he ſhould do or ſuffer for the World. And therefore the Apoſtle in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter, lays down that, <hi>viz. That God is the rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſeek him,</hi> as the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Belief, in confidence of which they willingly underwent ſo many Trials and Temptations with ſuch bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and undaunted reſolution. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we look upon theſe men onely as giving teſtimony to this truth, yet this alone is ſufficient reaſon for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and doth juſtifie the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our choice in being religious, and ſerving the ſame God on whom they believed, and forſaking all in obedience to him, as they did before us. Since we have the ſame convictions of Reaſon that they had, that our God whom we ſerve,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42893:81"/>
is a Rewarder of thoſe that put their truſt in him, and are further confirmed in our belief of this, by their patience and conſtancy in the ſame Profeſſion, and by their chearful ſuffering Perſecution for it. By their ſuffering we have this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at leaſt, that we are not ſingular in this our perſuaſion concerning God, and that he hath not been without his Witneſſes in all Ages, who have laid down their lives in this Faith and Aſſurance: and therefore we ought to be ſtedfaſt in it without wavering. Now if any ſhould object, that the numbers of thoſe who have died in this Faith, though they are here called a Cloud of Witneſſes, are yet but a very few in compariſon of thoſe who have lived without God in the World, and have deſpiſed and rejected all hopes of a future reward. To this it is eaſie to reply, that the credit of any teſtimony doth not depend on the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and noiſe of thoſe that affirm any thing; but from the manner of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they give. Now a few men who give ſufficient proof that they underſtand perfectly what they ſay and do, and would not deceive others, are more to be valued as Witneſſes, than ten thouſand of the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42893:82"/>
ruder multitude, who take up reports upon truſt, and if you come to examine them they ſhrink into nothing. They ſaid ſomething, they know not what; but know not whence they had it, nor why they ſaid it. The caſe is the ſame in matters of religion; thoſe that have been truly pious and religious, have in all Ages been men of the cleareſt and beſt underſtandings, that have always been able to give a reaſon of their Hope that was in them; and to ſatisfie the World that they did not pretend this for any temporal advantage; they did delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and chearfully expoſe themſelves to the moſt ſevere Trials and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their teſtimony of it, <hi>not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</hi> This was the caſe of thoſe Heroick Spirits recited in the foregoing Chapter. They were men of found mind, as appears by the glorious things they did and ſuffered, many of which are at large recorded in ſacred Story. They knew the value of life as well as others; they were ſenſible of diſgrace, and pain, and want, and could have no reaſon to expoſe themſelves to theſe things without a mighty evidence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42893:82"/>
and conviction of the truth of what they believed concerning God, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power, that he was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them after this life; of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Wiſdom, that he knew when and how to do it better than they could chooſe; of the Juſtice of his Providence, that he would certainly do it. But then on the contrary, for thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this belief, or at leaſt have not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved anſwerably to it, it is plain that much the greateſt part of them are onely a raſh inconſiderate multitude, of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe matters, who never took time to think whether Religion had any real foundation in Nature or Reaſon, or not; and therefore theſe are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges in the caſe, and not to be regarded as Witneſſes. For thoſe others, who have lived wickedly, and have yet had ſome reaſon to conſider of the grounds and obligations of a religious courſe of life; it is plain that theſe are moſt of them ſelf-condemned, and act againſt the conviction of their conſcience, being as it were bribed in their teſtimony by the love they bear to the pleaſures, and profits, and honours of this World. Now if we lay aſide theſe two ſorts of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42893:83"/>
men, thoſe that act by no principle of Reaſon at all, and thoſe who are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly corrupted by their luſts, and ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and contradict their own Reaſon; neither of which can be eſteemed fit men to be relied upon as Judges of Truth, the remainder of the World, if there be any not reducible to one of theſe two ſorts, is infinitely a leſs number than thoſe who have been conſtant Witneſſes to, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of the Divine Providence, and that with the loſs of all other things that are moſt dear to them, and of life it ſelf. And therefore I think it reaſonable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that though the Fathers in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter be conſidered onely as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this Truth in general, that God is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him; yet their examples added to the convictions of our own Reaſon are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtifie the wiſdom of our choice in being religious, though we had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motives to it than this: inaſmuch as they who renounce Religion, do it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without or againſt their Reaſon, and there can be no competent evidence on their ſide, who do ſo; but the force of their examples before mentioned will be yet more conſiderable to engage us to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42893:83"/>
imitate their patience, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great difference between their ſtate and ours, and the far greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we enjoy above them. How far their knowledge extended beyond the the principle before mentioned, it is not eaſie, nor neceſſary to determine. But thus much is plain, that their condition was much more imperfect than ours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. The knowledge they had of a future ſtate was dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the promiſes they received were myſterious and unevident; but now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel the caſe is much otherwiſe. The types, and ſhadows, and ceremonies of the Law, under which the promiſed Meſſias was obſcurely repreſented of old, are now exchanged for the ſubſtance it ſelf. Now life and immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel. We have now greater demonſtration of the goodneſs and mercy of God towards us than they had, in that he ſpared not his own Son, but gave him for us all. We have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proſpect of the promiſed reward. We have now clearer promiſes of the divine Spirit to aſſiſt and ſupport us in all our Trials, and to enable us to run our Race with patience. Theſe and many other
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42893:84"/>
advantages of knowledge we enjoy. Theſe encouragements to practiſe we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, beyond what the Fathers were acquainted with. And this the Apoſtle refers to in the concluſion of the former Chapter, <hi>Theſe all having obtained a good report through ſaith, received not the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; God having provided ſome better things for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> Now the inference from this conſideration is very plain and obvious. For if the Fathers before the coming of our Saviour, who received not thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and pretious promiſes which are revealed in the Goſpel, did yet exerciſe ſo great degrees of Faith, ſo mighty a confidence and truſt in God, as to endure ſuch bitter things in obedience to him as we read they did; how ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould this excite and provoke our zeal and fervor to follow after them in this glorious enterprize, and to run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Race ſet before us; how ſhould we be aſhamed and bluſh to read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of their ſufferings, and the glory of their vertues, if we who enjoy ſo many advantages above them, do yet come ſhort of their bravery and reſolution, and conſtant obedience to the will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42893:84"/>
3. The examples of thoſe who have gone before us in the ways of Vertue, ought to have this further influence to engage us in the like chearful diſcharge of our duty, inaſmuch as they are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the poſſibility of thoſe things that are required of us, in order to the attainment of that reward, the Crown we ſeek for. The hardeſt duties required of us have been long ſince accompliſhed by them; and accompliſhed with ſuch full aſſurance of hope, ſuch raviſhing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the joy ſet before them, as perfectly over-balanced all the difficulties they met with, and made them joyful and couragious amidſt the moſt ſevere tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let no man then pretend, that the commands of God are impoſſible to be kept; that his Laws are hard or grievous to be done, ſince we have ſeen them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in ſo high a manner, and that under a more imperfect diſpenſation than that of the Goſpel, as the ſtate of thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly was; nor is it a bare poſſibility of our task which we are taught by their example, but they are Witneſſes of the lovelineſs of Vertue, that it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and deſirable, worthy our choice and conſtant embraces, though it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42893:85"/>
with greateſt dangers and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. For if it were not ſo, it were not poſſible that all the Saints and Martyrs who have gone before us, ſhould have expreſſed ſo conſtant a joy and ſatisfaction in what they ſuffered for its ſake. It was a fanſiful ſuppoſition of <hi>Tully,</hi> that if Vertue could be ſeen by bodily eyes, it would appear ſo comely and amiable, ſo beautiful and lovely, that men would need no other arguments to invite them to embrace it. I will not ſay this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altogether extravagant, becauſe it may fairly be underſtood of thoſe great examples of Vertue, ſome of which have appeared in all Ages, to vindicate its practice from all the diſadvantages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the folly and ſlothfulneſs of men is wont to repreſent it. In brave and Heroick examples Vertue appears as it were clothed with fleſh and blood, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the eyes of the moſt ſtupid and inſenſible; ſince there are none ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and ſavage, who will not follow a truly vertuous man with reverence and applauſe, though they ſee him oft-times clouded by affliction, and oppreſſed by the malicious and unjuſt. The truth is, no kind of Arguments hath greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42893:85"/>
of perſuaſion, and leave us more without Excuſe than good and vertuous Examples. Others may ſpeak great things in commendation of Vertue, and the Reward prepared for it; but if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they live not as they teach, there is an eaſie anſwer to be made to ſuch Exhortations, and we may be apt to reply, Surely theſe men do not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they endeavour to perſuade us; for if they did, it would be their intereſt to practiſe Vertue as well as ours; and why do they neglect it? But when men teach us by Example as well as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then they may urge their precepts with good aſſurance, and we have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or pretence left, why we ſhould not follow and imitate them.</p>
            <p>The Saints therefore and Martyrs, who have left behind them ſuch glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of their obedience and faith in God, and patient ſufferings for conſcience ſake, do herein give us the moſt powerful motives to a like ſtedfaſtneſs in our Holy Calling; inaſmuch as they bear witneſs by their Examples, that there are no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſo great in the ways of Holineſs, no afflictions ſo grievous, but that by the power of a lively and active faith, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42893:86"/>
by a proſpect of the Joy ſet before us, and by the aſſiſtance of Gods grace in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our duty, they may be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with patience and comfort, nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with joy and ſatisfaction. Let us now caſt our eyes back on thoſe great Examples of Faith and Patience recorded in the foregoing Chapter; let us behold the mighty power and efficacy of their Faith, and the bravery of their Vertues in its moſt afflicted ſtate: let us call to mind the chearfulneſs and joy with which they trampled on, and deſpiſed the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this life preſent, that they might obtain a better inheritance. Let us add to theſe the glorious company of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts, the noble Army of Martyrs and Confeſſors, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companies of juſt men made perfect, who have departed this life in the Faith of Chriſt, being Witneſſes to us of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promiſes than the Fathers had. And laſtly, let us look unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the Joy ſet before him endured the Croſs, deſpiſed the Shame, and is now ſet down upon the right hand of the Throne of God; and then ſurely, if the Apoſtles Argument was a reaſonable motive in his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42893:86"/>
days, it will now be much more ſo, ſince the Cloud of Witneſſe is ſo much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Saints and Martyrs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing we alſo are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us; and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi>

            <p>THere is no kind of Argument more naturally fitted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon mens minds, and to engage their induſtry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in any enterpriſe whatſoever, than the example of others who have gone before them; whoſe wiſdom and vertue they have in reverence; who have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42893:88"/>
the like undertaking with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſucceſs. The opinion we have of their wiſdom and vertue, makes us think it not unreaſonable for us to follow their ſteps, and imitate their practice; and the ſucceſs of their endeavours takes away all thoſe faint excuſes which Sloth and Idleneſs are apt to ſuggeſt to us. We cannot then pretend that it is an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble task we are perſuaded to, when we ſee before our eyes the examples of others of like frame with our ſelves, who have already performed it with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and joy.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle therefore well knowing that the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity was to be attended with many difficulties and dangers, and that our Saviour had made it a neceſſary qualification of all that would be his Diſciples, <hi>to take up the Croſs and follow him;</hi> to prepare the minds of his new converted Hebrews againſt all diſcouragements whatſoever, that might withdraw them from their ſtedfaſtneſs in the Faith they had embraced, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter of the Epiſtle, he largely repreſents to them the many examples of the Patriarchs of old, whoſe Seed they were; of the holy Prophets, whoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42893:88"/>
they had received; of all the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies recorded in Sacred Story, whoſe Praiſes they had been inſtructed in; that all theſe, in confidence that God would reward their Obedience and Faith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, though he ſuffered them to be evil intreated here, had patiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the moſt barbarous cruelties, which the wit or malice of men could exerciſe upon them. Some of them were ſtoned and ſawn in ſunder; ſome of them wandered about, being deſtitute, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, tormented; but yet theſe, and many other kinds of calamities they chearfully ſubmitted to, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And then applying their examples to the ſtate of thoſe firſt Chriſtians, he gives them to underſtand, that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before recited by the power of their Faith were enabled to endure ſuch things as theſe, then ſurely they who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved far better promiſes ought not to fall ſhort of their patience, and reſolution, and conſtant perſeverance in their holy Profeſſion, though they ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to many Trials and Perſecutions for it.</p>
            <p>This application he makes in the words before the Text; <hi>Wherefore, ſeeing we alſo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42893:89"/>
               <hi>are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> But becauſe the duty of Patience under Sufferings is that which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we are naturally moſt averſe to, that there might be nothing wanting to confirm their reſolution to go on chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Race ſet before them, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the Text to raiſe their thoughts to the contemplation of a far more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and illuſtrious example, whom they ought always to have in their eye, as the beſt pattern of their Obedience, and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtrongeſt motives and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to it: <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering the words with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, they are a prevailing argument and motive to engage us to imitate our Saviour, as in all other parts of a holy converſation; ſo more particularly in the patient ſuffering of thoſe afflictions and calamities which befall us in this life. Which duty, though it have a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42893:89"/>
reference to the ſtate of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, who were continually expoſed to the moſt unſupportable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities for their profeſſion of Chriſtianity; yet we are not to perſuade our ſelves that we in theſe days are wholly exempt from our ſhare in it. Though open Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions are not now felt among us, yet all that will live godly, have many Trials and Temptations to oppoſe themſelves againſt, many difficulties and dangers to ſtruggle with, many enemies to withſtand through the whole courſe of their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, who are always active and buſie to hinder our progreſs in our Chriſtian Race, and to defeat us of our Reward and Crown. Though we are not now brought before Kings and Rulers for the ſake of Chriſt, though we cannot now be tempted to a total Apoſtaſie from our Chriſtian Profeſſion, to an open denial of the Lord that bought us, yet ſtill we are expoſed to many temptations which are apt to draw us from our uprightneſs, and to betray us into thoſe evil habits and cuſtoms which are inconſiſtent with the Faith which we outwardly proſeſs, and with the Salvation we hope for. We have therefore need of great watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42893:90"/>
and care, and conſtant reſolution, if we would preſerve our innocency and integrity amidſt ſo many and dangerous temptations. We have need of patience, if we would deny our ſelves all thoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular gratifications, to which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and our own hearts Luſt are apt to entice and invite us; and therefore the conſideration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours example of Patience under Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may ſtill be very uſeful to us, though we be not called to ſuffer Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for his names ſake. And then for Perſecution it ſelf, though it be a caſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom happens, yet ſuch is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſtianity, that every one that undertakes the profeſſion of it, muſt at leaſt, in preparation of ſoul, be ready to lay down his life, rather than renounce it. Now in order to confirm our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and reſolution in our Holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, notwithſtanding any temptations we meet with in the World, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any afflictions or calamities that may befal us, the Apoſtle recommends this as a moſt effectual means, to <hi>look unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our Faith, who, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42893:90"/>
               <hi>and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words the bleſſed JESUS is repreſented unto us under a two-fold Character, each of which affords very proper and ſuitable Arguments to ingage us in imitation of him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to look unto him, as the Author of our Faith. This is in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a Military term, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Captain and Leader, one who hath gone before us with bravery and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath commanded us to follow his ſteps. This is further explained in the following part of the Verſe, <hi>who, for the joy ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſhame.</hi> If we look unto Jeſus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Character, the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very piain and convincing; that ſince the Author and Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation did not refuſe himſelf to undergo the moſt unſupportable calamities of this life, and to ſuffer a painful and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death, in proſpect of that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward which he ſaw prepared for him; neither ought we, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be his Diſciples and Souldiers refuſe to follow him in the ſame track, that we may partake with him in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42893:91"/>
ſame joy. Eſpecially if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he is not onely the Captain of our Faith, but the finiſher and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of it. This is in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, the Rewarder of our Faith. This is further expreſt in the latter clauſe of the Verſe, where the Apoſtle declaring the iſſue and event of our Saviours ſufferings, tells us, he <hi>is ſet down on the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Which words expreſs theſe two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Saviour hath himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the full Reward of his humiliation and ſufferings, <hi>being ſet down at the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And which is conſequent from that, that he is now endued with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority and power abundantly to reward thoſe who ſuffer with him, and after his example.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and ſhall conſider our Saviour as <hi>Author and Captain of our Faith,</hi> the great Pattern and Example of Patience, <hi>who, for the joy ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame.</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42893:91"/>
And to ſhew the force of the Apoſtles Argument,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall firſt conſider the ſufferings themſelves which our Saviour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, expreſſed here by two compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive words, the CROSS and the SHAME.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner of his enduring them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Example to engage us to follow and imitate him.</p>
            <p>To begin with his Sufferings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Though the Croſs and the Shame here ſpoken of, do principally refer to the great and unparallel'd inſtance of our Saviours Sufferings, which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all the reſt, even his painful and ignominious Death; yet I conceive they may not unfitly be extended to the whole Hiſtory of them, from his Birth unto that very time. If therefore we take a ſhort view of our Saviours whole life and actions, we ſhall eaſily diſcern
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42893:92"/>
that the prophecy was throughly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, wherein he is repreſented <hi>as a man of ſorrow, and acquainted with grief.</hi> Not to mention the meanneſs of his Birth, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of his condition, the early Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſed againſt him by <hi>Herod,</hi> nor thoſe other accidents that befel him in his younger years. Not to mention theſe things, I ſhall confine my diſcourſe to thoſe inſtances of Suffering which befel him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he began to ſhew himſelf to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by ſigns and wonders to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Son of God, the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, that according to the Prophets was to come into the World. And I ſhall repreſent them under theſe two heads an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe in the Text, the great ignominy and reproach which was caſt upon his perſon through the whole courſe of his Miniſtry; and then the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and painful circumſtances that went before, and accompanied his Death and Paſſion.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if we conſider the quality of our Saviours perſon, that he was the true Meſſias, ſo long foretold by the Prophets, and at that very time expected by the Jews; if we conſider the great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proof that he gave of theſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42893:92"/>
things, <hi>viz.</hi> the fulfilling all the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ſpake of him ſo punctually and ſo particularly; his delivering ſuch a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to them that carried with it all the evidence of a divine authority; his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch mighty works among them, which by their own confeſſion no man could do, unleſs God were with him, his healing the ſick, and curing diſeaſes and caſting out Devils, giving eyes to the blind, reſtoring the lame, raiſing the dead, all which could be the effect of no leſſer cauſe, than the Almighty power of God, atteſting the truth of what he ſpake, and the authority of his miſſion. He that conſiders theſe things might reaſonably expect, that ſo divine a perſon at his firſt appearance ſhould have been entertained with the greateſt demonſtration of joy and triumph; and doubtleſs had the Jews themſelves been demanded before-hand, what honour was fit to be given to their long looked for Meſſias when he came, they could not have contrived any ways of reſpect ſuitable to their great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of him; they would have thought no kind of homage too great to be paid to the perſon whom God had ſent to them ſo immediately, and upon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42893:93"/>
ſo advantageous a meſſage. But behold on the contrary, when this Prince and Saviour did at length appear in the fulneſs of time, though there was no teſtimony wanting to confirm him to be the very CHRIST, yet becauſe he came not with outward pomp and ſplendor, had none of the gilded Pageantries of the World to attend him in his appearance, this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice alone was ſufficient with them to over-ballance the ſtrongeſt demonſtration that could poſſibly be given. <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> they thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient confutation of all the mighty things he ſpake and did. So that in ſtead of thoſe joyful acclamations with which he ought to have been entertained, in ſtead of that honour and reſpect that was due to his high Character, he met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Scorn and Deriſion, Ignominy and Reproach; and that in thoſe very caſes, wherein they ought to have paid him the moſt profound homage and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For inſtance in the execution of his prophetick Office. Though the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he taught was the moſt divine and heavenly that ever was made known to the Sons of men: though by their own confeſſion he ſpake among them as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42893:93"/>
man ſpake before; though he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten confuted the great Doctors out of the Law and the Prophets, which they thought themſelves the beſt Interpreters of; yet ſo far were they from yielding to the conviction, or owning his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that they took occaſion rather from thence to contrive his ruine, and to repreſent him under the odious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one that endeavoured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Law and the Prophets, which he came moſt eminently to fulfil. Again, when he went about his Fathers buſineſs, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, and for that end vouchſafed to converſe with Publicans and Sinners, that he might reduce them from their evil ways; though this was really an inſtance of the greateſt goodneſs and compaſſion towards them; yet for this they revile him, making it an occaſion of the fouleſt calumny, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of him as a Glutton and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners. Laſtly, to name no more, when he went about doing good, curing diſeaſes, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil, who could expect but that ſuch mighty inſtances of his power and goodneſs ſhould have extorted from them the moſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42893:94"/>
grateful acknowledgments? But in ſtead of this, ſome of them deſire him to depart out of their Coaſts; others revile him as though he did all theſe mighty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable works by the help of the Devil, caſting out Devils by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of them. Thus the unſpotted innocency of his life, the purity of his doctrine, the mighty power which he ſhewed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, and the many good deeds done among them to all that ſtood in need and craved his aſſiſtance; all which were in their own nature admirably fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to excite their love and veneration of him; all theſe were made uſe of by the Jews to the quite contrary purpoſe, and became the occaſions of the greateſt calumny and malice towards him. But I haſten to the great inſtance of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Sufferings, even the bitter and moſt painful circumſtances that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and accompanied his Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>When the appointed time was come that the Meſſias was to be cut off, our Saviour well knowing the approach of it, ſought no means to eſcape the danger, becauſe he knew it was his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleaſure that he ſhould ſuffer ſuch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42893:94"/>
things, and that otherwiſe the Scriptures would not be fulfilled. He therefore prepared his Diſciples for it, giving them warning that one of them ſhould betray him, and that the hour was now come. Having therefore eaten the Paſsover with his Diſciples, and put an end to that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony which was figurative of himſelf, and having inſtituted his laſt Supper to be kept for ever in remembrance of him, he goes out to the Mount of Olives, there to be in readineſs to meet thoſe that ſought him, to take away his life. There it was that our bleſſed Saviour, out of deep apprehenſions of that great weight of afflictions that was now to be laid upon him, that he was to bear our grief, and carry our ſorrows, began to be exceeding ſorrowful even unto death, and fell into that bitter agony, wherein he ſweat drops of bloud. And here what words can expreſs, what thoughts can ſufficiently conceive the greatneſs of thoſe pains that befel our Saviour, when the very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of their approach made ſo deep an impreſſion upon the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and put him in ſo ſtrange an agony, and extorted from him the earneſt peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he made <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvj. 39. <hi>O my</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42893:95"/>
               <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Sure it is that never was ſuch height of malice expreſt againſt one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon as was againſt our Saviour, nor was affliction ever aggravated with ſuch grievous circumſtances as his was. He was betraied by one of his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, betraied by one who had been all along a witneſs of his mighty Works, a hearer of his doctrine, a conſtant parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of thoſe benefits which he ſo freely beſtowed on all; betrayed by him who had ſo often eat at his Table; betraid by that very action whereby he was wont to expreſs his homage to him. Being thus betraid into the hands of Sinners, they deal with him as the vileſt Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, they hurry him to the high Prieſts houſe, where the Scribes and the Elders condemn him of Blaſphemy, for no other reaſon, but for affirming the truth to them, that he was the Son of God, which they could not diſprove. Then they go on to the moſt inſolent expreſſions of ſcorn and contempt of him; they ſpit in his face, and buffeted him; others ſmote him with the palms of their hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Propheſie unto us, who is it that</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42893:95"/>
               <hi>ſmote thee?</hi> After this infamous manner was the Son of God treated by theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and wicked men, to whom he came to do the greateſt good, had they been capable of receiving it. Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice did not reſt here. Though they had offered him all the vileſt indignities, yet this was not ſufficient to ſatisfie their rage. Nothing would do that, but the ſhedding his moſt pretious and innocent bloud. And becauſe it was not in their own power to paſs the ſentence of death upon him, they being now under the Roman yoke, therefore they haſten the next morning to bring him before <hi>Pilate</hi> the Roman Governour, to demand ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death from him. And here, that they might give ſome plauſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their malice, they invent a new accuſation againſt him, charging him with a new kind of crime, that he was guilty of Treaſon, making himſelf a King. When <hi>Pilate</hi> was unſatisfied with their proof of this, they ſupply their want of proof with the loudneſs of their clamours, crying out, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> was ſtill unwilling to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue his hands with this innocent bloud, demanding ſtill a further reaſon of their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42893:96"/>
proceedings againſt him, ſaying, Why, what evil hath he done? he gained no other anſwer but importunate clamours, and they cried out the more, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi> And doubtleſs the injuſtice of theſe clamours was very evident to <hi>Pilate;</hi> though none of the juſteſt Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he was yet deſirous to clear himſelf of this guilt; inſomuch that he waſhed his hands before the multitude, proteſting his innocency as to the bloud of that juſt man, and charged them with it. And here we may behold the ſtrange preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy of theſe mens malice, that rather than not obtain one ſingle deſign of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon the moſt innocent perſon in the World, they wilfully devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterity to ruine, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>His bloud be upon us and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O moſt horrid and dreadful impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation! For who can conceive the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite horrour of their guilt, and the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vengeance they called for upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when he conſiders how pretious and ineſtimable the value of that bloud was, which they was ſo haſty to ſpill? What remains now, but that having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from <hi>Pilate</hi> the moſt unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42893:96"/>
they ſhould now proceed to the execution of it? But leſt his death too ſhould want any circumſtance which might aggravate his grief and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they contrived all imaginable ways to heap more indignities upon him. Then they ſtripped him, and ſcourged him, and mocked and put on him a Crown of Thorns, a Scarlet Robe, and a Reed in his hand. What ſhould I mention the further mockeries they uſed towards him? the prodigious cruelty of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they put him to; nailing his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hands and feet to the Infamous Tree, and leaving the whole weight of his Body to be ſupported even by thoſe wounds. In theſe ſad circumſtances of diſgrace and pain did the HOLY JESUS ſuffer, which though they were the moſt ſharp and bitter which the wit or malice of men could invent, had yet a further aggravation, which infinitely exceeds all that we can ſpeak or think: for beſides the extream violence of his bodily pains, beſides the moſt barbarous indignities and affronts offered to him, there was yet a far greater weight of ſorrow hung upon his ſoul, than his enemies could bring upon him: the burden of our ſins
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42893:97"/>
then lay heavy upon him, and the weight of our iniquity preſſed his ſoul down; and this we may eaſily conceive was the true cauſe of that bitter agony and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſweat which he was in before appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. This was that which, while he hung upon the Croſs, made him cry out in the bitterneſs of his Spirit, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me?</hi> And now let us look unto JESUS under theſe doleful circumſtances, and conſider if ever ſorrow was like unto his ſorrow. That we may therefore more effectually be moved to an imitation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the ſecond thing propoſed, to conſider after what manner the HOLY JESUS demeaned himſelf under theſe Agonies; <hi>For the joy ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame.</hi> In which words is expreſſed the deportment of our Saviour, thus much at leaſt, that his undergoing theſe calamities was free and voluntary, that he did it out of choice, <hi>for the joy ſet before him.</hi> But what is wanting in the Text may eaſily be ſupplyed out of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in holy Scripture: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liij. 7. The Prophet deſcribing the manner of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42893:97"/>
tells us, <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth.</hi> Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was ſo exactly and punctually ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by him, as nothing could be more. For notwithſtanding all the heavy preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that lay on him, who ever heard one murmuring or diſcontented word, one leaſt complaint againſt the method of Gods dealing with him? But in the moſt bitter circumſtances of all, though he prayed for a deliverance from the evils he felt, and from thoſe he foreſaw were ready to enſue; yet this was done with the moſt perfect reſignation of himſelf to his Fathers will, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Our Saviour was not of that ſort of men, who pretend to be unmoved by any pain or trouble. His patience was no ſtupid inſenſibility of the things he felt; no, he was of as tender ſenſe as other men, and the pains he felt were ſuch as would have diſturbed the evenneſs of the ſtouteſt Stoick, awakened the moſt reſolute. But in this the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of our Saviours patience appeared,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42893:98"/>
that notwithſtanding the Agonies he felt were ſo full of anguiſh and ſorrow, he could yet in the midſt of theſe tortures entirely ſubmit himſelf to his heavenly Fathers will, ſaying, <hi>Father, if this cup may not paſs away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</hi> Nor are the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Saviours patience leſs remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he ſhewed in his behaviour towards men. For notwithſtanding thoſe many affronts and indignities which were offered to him from that ungrateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jews, notwithſtanding all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and violence they purſued him with, he never uttered one angry or revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word againſt them. <hi>When he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> Nay, ſo far was he from making any leaſt return to thoſe many injuries he received from them, that even in the midſt of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in that unconceivable anguiſh which he felt hanging upon the Croſs, he omitted not to pray for forgiveneſs for them, ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> After this manner did the HOLY JESUS ſuffer, bearing all reproaches and indignities
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42893:98"/>
from men with the greateſt meekneſs, anſwering not a word to all their calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; bearing the moſt piercing and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pains with the greateſt patience and ſubmiſſion to his Fathers Will; and this he did as S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>Leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> Which leads me to the third thing to be conſidered, the Influence of our Saviours Example to engage us in imitation of him; and this will appear many ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider the greatneſs of thoſe ſufferings which our Saviour underwent; they were ſuch as infinitely exceed all that we can poſſibly be expoſed to, as may appear by what hath been already ſaid. If therefore God was pleaſed to lay ſo great a burden upon his beloved Son, in whom he was well-pleaſed, and if the Son of God were willing chearfully to endure ſuch bitter things, becauſe he knew it was his heavenly Fathers will, and that otherwiſe the Scriptures could not be fulfilled; how unreaſonable muſt it needs be for us to murmur and repine at thoſe leſſer afflictions, which God may call us to; and yet, alas, how apt are we to complain and murmur at every little accident and diſappointment that befalls
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42893:99"/>
us here? How forward are we to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the unequal diſtribution of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, and to think ourſelves hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with? and though poſſibly we do not make complaint directly againſt Heaven, nor call in queſtion the juſtice of Gods providence towards us, yet the inſtruments of his providence, the men he ſuffers to afflict us, ſeldom eſcape our ſevereſt cenſure.</p>
            <p>But now to qualifie our minds in theſe caſes, and to reſtrain our too paſſionate reſentments of the injuries we meet with, let us take the Apoſtles advice, and look unto <hi>Jeſus;</hi> what he ſuffered and after what manner. Are any of thoſe affronts and indignities that have been offered us, in the leaſt degree anſwerable to thoſe contumelious uſages which the HOLY JESUS was expoſed to? Are any of our calamities comparable to thoſe bitter pains which he endured upon the Croſs? Or is there any ſorrow can ſo deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our ſoul, as that unconceivable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his did, which made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> but yet notwithſtanding the infinite weight of his afflictions, the piercing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his pain, we find not the leaſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42893:99"/>
ſyllable of complaint proceed from him againſt this proceeding of his Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; no word of reproach or reſentment againſt his moſt barbarous and implacable Enemies. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look unto JESUS under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and then we cannot but be ſenſible how ill it becomes us who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be his Diſciples, and call our ſelves by his name, to be ſo angry and impatient under thoſe light afflictions we are called to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Saviours Sufferings have this farther influence to engage us in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Patience, becauſe the perfect innocency of his life had merited none of thoſe things. <hi>He knew no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth. He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> And therefore might juſtly have claimed exemption from thoſe miſeries he under-went, and have withdrawn his ſhoulders from bearing the heavy burden which it pleaſed his Father to lay on him. If he therefore when he might have avoided thoſe calamities that befel him, when he could have called for more than twelve Legions of Angels to reſcue him from his danger, choſe rather to ſubmit
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42893:100"/>
to all thoſe indignities he foreſaw would be heaped upon him in obedience to his heavenly Father; how much rather ought we without repining quietly to ſit down under the afflicting hand of God? we, who can ſuffer nothing in this World ſo grievous which we have not deſerved; we, whoſe ſins do every day provoke Gods indignation againſt us. What ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Plea can we have, why God ſhould not uſe the moſt ſevere chaſtiſements upon us? And certainly, if God ſpared not his own Son, but gave him up to thoſe calamities he had not deſerved; we have all the reaſon in the World to ſubmit to him, notwithſtanding any trouble he brings upon us; and to take up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the penitent Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>We indeed ſuffer juſtly, for we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the due reward of our deeds,</hi> but the HOLY JESUS had done nothing amiſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A further Argument which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our Saviours Sufferings ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts to us, to engage us to a like patient ſubmiſſion to the will of God, may be taken from the end and deſign of his Sufferings, which was the greateſt deſign of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love to us, that could be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: and therefore ought to engage us
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42893:100"/>
to a ſuitable return of obedience and love to him, though it were to die for his ſake as he did for ours, and to ſuffer the moſt ſevere Trials that it ſhall pleaſe him to appoint us to undergo. When all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, like Sheep, had gone aſtray, when they had all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God; and made themſelves lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the utmoſt ſeverity of his anger and juſtice; when we were dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, and were in no capacity to help our ſelves, or contrive our own recovery; then it pleaſed the Son of God out of his tender compaſſion and inimitable love to mankind, to come down from heaven the habitation of Glory, to take upon him our fleſh, to ſubmit to all the miſeries and ſorrows of humane life; and laſtly to ſuffer the moſt painful and ignominious death of the Croſs, to redeem us from the bondage and dominion of ſin, and from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of it, and to make us capable of life and ſalvation. Bleſſed Lord! what was man, that thou ſhouldſt be ſo mindful of him? what is the Son of man that thou ſhouldſt ſo regard him, as to debaſe thy ſelf in ſuch a manner, and to ſubmit to all the vileſt indignities, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42893:101"/>
moſt unſupportable pains, to reſcue him from that miſery which by his own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unreaſonable choice he had brought upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>O the ineſtimable riches of love which the HOLY JESUS expreſſed towards us in theſe his ſufferings! and now what ſhall we render for all his goodneſs! is there any thing which we can be unwilling to do for the ſake of him, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for us? We ſee then that the obligation of our Saviours example to engage us to follow him in the patient ſuffering thoſe calamities that befal us, is very plain and evident, becauſe his Sufferings were undertaken for our ſake and benefit, and he requires this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our love and gratitude for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy towards us, that we alſo ſhould take up our Croſs chearfully, and follow him whereſoever we are called to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The conſideration of our Saviours Sufferings and Death, are a further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to a like Patience under and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of God, becauſe they are a ſtrong evidence of that future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is prepared for thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue faithful to the end, and run with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42893:101"/>
patience the Chriſtian Race ſet before them. Our Saviour while he was yet alive promiſed many Bleſſings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Diſciples and Followers, moſt of which were to have their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in another life: in the mean time he foretold them, that in this World they ſhould have tribulation, and that they muſt be always ready to forſake Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Brethren and Siſters, yea and their own lives alſo, if they would be his Diſciples. However, that there was a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward laid up for them in Heaven, which they ſhould not fail to partake of, if they continued ſtedfaſt in this Faith, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their courſe with patience. Now our Saviour could give no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of thoſe promiſes he made to them, and of the ſincerity of his intentions in preſſing this duty of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under Sufferings, than that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was willing to go before them in this ſo painful and laborious an enterprize, and to endure the worſt of thoſe evils which he foretold ſhould befal them in proſpect of the joy ſet before him, which he promiſed they ſhould partake of. Had
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42893:102"/>
he not undoubted aſſurance of the truth of thoſe things he ſpake to his Diſciples, he would not doubtleſs have expoſed himſelf to ſo many hazards for affirming them; but the aſſurance he had was ſtrong and convincing, ſuch as he knew he could not be miſtaken in. And therefore in <hi>John</hi> xvij. 2. he ſpeaks of his own power, which he was to receive upon account of his ſufferings, with the ſame aſſurance, as though it had been already accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> This our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpake before his Paſſion, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued a mighty confidence he had that he ſhould receive this reward of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Sufferings, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given him; and this was <hi>that joy ſet before him,</hi> expreſſed in the latter clauſe of the Verſe by <hi>his ſitting down at the right hand of the throne of God,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which <hi>he endured the Croſs, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſhame.</hi> And we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World to believe that he who could endure ſo much ignominy, ſhame and pain, for the obtaining this Reward, was both ſufficiently certain of the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42893:102"/>
of it, that it would be made good to him upon the accompliſhment of his Sufferings; and likewiſe that this joy ſet before him was of ineſtimable value, and far exceeding thoſe tribulations and ſorrows he undertook in order to it. And laſtly, that he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Followers with the promiſe of an imaginary Joy, ſince he did himſelf endure ſuch real and unexpreſſible pains to obtain it for, and confirm it to them.</p>
            <p>The ſum of this Argument is briefly this: Our bleſſed Saviour endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame in full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the certainty of the Joy ſet before him, and of the ineſtimable value of it above the proportion of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and therefore that we alſo ought to imitate his Patience, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by his Example, that the light afflictions of this life, which endure but a moment, are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed; and that if we ſuffer with the HOLY JESUS we ſhall be alſo glorified together.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the force of the Apoſtles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42893:103"/>
from the Sufferings of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to engage us to imitate his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and to ſuffer with him when Gods calls us to it; but we muſt not confine the influence of our Saviours Sufferings to this ſingle duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Race ſet before us,</hi> mentioned in the former Verſe, may fairly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the whole Courſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Converſation; and our Saviours Sufferings and Death have doubtleſs a very great efficacy to oblige us not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the patient enduring Afflictions and Calamities, but to an univerſal and impartial obedience to the will of God. For with what face can we look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to JESUS, and conſider the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight of ſorrow which he endured for the ſins of men, and not be aſhamed and bluſh again to be guilty of any of thoſe ſins, which put the Son of God to ſuch ſhame and pain? Or how can we call to mind his boundleſs compaſſion and love to us in enduring ſuch things for our ſake, without being effectually moved to render to him all poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of our thankfulneſs and love for all his benefits? Which we cannot
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42893:103"/>
better expreſs, than by a ſincere and conſtant obedience to the precepts of the Goſpel, and by walking before him in all holineſs and godlineſs of living. Which that we may all do, God of his infinite mercy grant, for the ſake and merits of our bleſſed Saviour; to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and praiſe, and glory, henceforth and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>ONe great priviledge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Mankind, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from, and far excel the Beaſts that periſh is this; that whereas other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are either wholly determined in their actions, by outward and neceſſary cauſes, or at leaſt are led on by thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects onely which are preſent, and work
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42893:105"/>
immediately upon their ſenſes, without any proſpect of, or regard to future and remote events; Men onely by comparing cauſes and effects are able to make an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and value of future good and evil, and accordingly to determine their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actions and choice, in proportion to thoſe ends which they propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore though all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſeek after good, and are averſe to thoſe things which are painful and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; yet if they are well aſſured that what is now pleaſing and delightful to them, will be the certain cauſe of future and more laſting evils than can be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any preſent and tranſitory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This conſideration to thoſe that uſe their reaſon is ſufficient to put a check to, and divert them from any preſent enjoyments, which will in the event be dangerous and hurtful. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the ſame principle men may be encouraged to undergo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and hardſhips, if they can be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that their preſent ſufferings ſhall be recompenſed with a ſuitable reward and ſatisfaction for the time to come. And therefore no kind of Arguments are more naturally fitted to perſuade men to the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42893:105"/>
practice of Vertue and Goodneſs, and to diſcourage them from the contrary ways of Sin and Wickedneſs, than a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe ſeveral ends which they lead to, and of thoſe Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which will be the unavoidable events of them. And accordingly no kind of perſuaſions are more frequent in the Goſpel, than thoſe which are taken from an expectation of a judgment to come, and from thoſe incomparable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which will then be the portion of the Righteous, and the unſpeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which will be the lot of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Diſobedient. And this is that which the Apoſtle particularly inſiſts on in this place, as the ground of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord, we perſuade men.</hi> In theſe words there are many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of great weight and moment, worthy of our moſt ſerious conſideration; which I ſhall briefly repreſent to you.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42893:106"/>
1. Here is the certainty of a Judgment to come, declared in theſe words, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the perſon before whom we muſt appear, it is <hi>the Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</hi> He, who was before our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Advocate, who came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from our iniquities, and to make us capable of being happy in another life, will then be our Judge, and will actually diſpenſe thoſe rewards he promiſed to thoſe, for whom they are prepared, and will alſo be the ſevere avenger of thoſe who would not be reclaimed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here are expreſſed the perſons that muſt appear. <hi>We,</hi> we the ſame men that are now alive in the body, though our earthly tabernacles be diſſolved, though our bodies die and ſee corruption, yet <hi>we</hi> our ſelves muſt again appear. The ſame Almighty power, which at firſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us in our Mothers Wombs, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly faſhioned all the parts of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though they be diſſolved into duſt and variouſly ſcattered over the earth, will again reſtore them to life, and we
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42893:106"/>
ſhall again appear, the ſame men that we were before: For <hi>we</hi> muſt appear and no other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is expreſſed the univerſality of the appearance, <hi>We muſt all appear;</hi> all men that ever lived or ſhall live upon the Earth, high or low, rich or poor, no order or degree of men excepted, we muſt all then make our appearance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is ſomething conſiderable in the appearance it ſelf. Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> interprets the Phraſe, <hi>We muſt appear,</hi> onely with analogy to Tribunals of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice among men; that as Priſoners at the Bar are wont to be ſet in a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous place in order to their Trial; ſo we alſo muſt give our appearance before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt. But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath a more important ſignification, and muſt be underſtood not onely of our being actually preſent at Gods Tribunal, but we muſt appear or be made manifeſt, as the ſame word is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in the following Verſe; and then the Apoſtle means thus much, that all our hidden actions and ſecret deſigns, which are now undiſcovered by men,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42893:107"/>
ſhall then at the Judgement Seat of Chriſt be made manifeſt and laid open to us before God and all his holy Angels. We have now many ways to hide our ſelves, and to diſguiſe our actions from the knowledge of men; we can now put on the Mask and Garb of a Righteous man, and appear as ſuch to the World, when our hearts are full of wickedneſs and deceit: but at the Judgment of the Great Day all theſe arts will avail us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; our falſe pretences will then be diſcovered, our diſguiſe pulled off, our hypocriſie made viſible and manifeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all things are naked and open before him, with whom we have to do: <hi>and we muſt all appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Here is the method that will be uſed at the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, <hi>Every one ſhall receive the things done in the body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Here is the uſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of all theſe conſiderations, <hi>Knowing therefore theſe terrours of the Lord:</hi> and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured how dreadful this appearance and the event of it will be, <hi>we perſuade</hi> men
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42893:107"/>
that they would now behave themſelves as men that muſt then appear; but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt particularly on all theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would be too large an Exerciſe of your Patience. I ſhall therefore confine my Diſcourſe to theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall endeavour to remind you of thoſe grounds and reaſons by which we may be aſſured of a Judgment to come; that we muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall conſider the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding at the Day of Judgment, <hi>Every man ſhall receive the things done in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall draw ſome inferences that may be of uſe to us in the government of our lives. Firſt of the truth and certainty of a Judgment to come. And this will appear upon theſe following accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the dictates and teſtimony of our own Conſcience.</item>
               <item>2. From the Nature of God and his Attributes.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:42893:108"/>
3. From the concurrent teſtimony and belief of all Nations.</item>
               <item>4. From the particular revelation of this truth in holy Scripture.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. If we look into the ſecrets of our own ſouls, and examine the natural powers we are endued with, they will afford us great evidence that there is a Judgment to come, when we ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account for our actions here, and be rewarded or puniſhed according to them. The knowledge of good and evil, and the obligation to do one and eſchew the other, is naturally written in the Soul of Man; nor can any man be wicked without violence to his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and beſt faculties. Every man bears about with him a ſecret Monitor in his boſom, which upon the temptations to evil doth faithfully forewarn him of it; and upon the commiſſion of evil doth afflict his ſoul with a ſenſe of guilt, and with a fearful expectation of puniſhment due upon it. On the contrary, there is a ſecret joy and ſatisfaction naturally ſprings up in the ſoul of a good man, which is an exceeding ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42893:108"/>
to him in the diſcharge of his duty; which enables him to bear many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and oppoſitions which oft-times attend him in the practice of Vertue; his conſcience breeding in him a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and aſſurance of ſome future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his good deeds. Now that conſcience is thus active and buſie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn men of the evil which they are about to do, and to ſet before them in order the evils they have done, and to ſupport them in doing good, every man, that gives himſelf the leiſure to attend to the motions of his own mind, may be convinced by his own experience. Or if we would rather learn from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of others, it were eaſie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a crowd of Witneſſes, which give us large deſcriptions of the unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burden a troubled ſpirit, and the great comfort and ſecurity of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence. And now would we know the true ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe hopes and fears, which the conſcience naturally ſuggeſts to us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our actions whether good or bad, there is no ſufficient reaſon of them can be aſſigned but this, that they are the voice of God and Nature forewarning
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42893:109"/>
us of another ſtate after this; when all men ſhall be recompenſed according to that they have done here. For that the fears and diſquiets of a guilty conſcience are indeed the effects of Nature, and are not grounded upon the apprehenſion of temporal puniſhment, or of the Laws of men, as ſome vainly ſuppoſe, is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident in that thoſe perſons, who have been beyond the reach and above the fears of any earthly Tribunal, have yet been the greateſt examples of this force of conſcience. The Story of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> is in every bodies mouth, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſignal inſtance of this truth. He, who was poſſeſſed with ſo unlimited a Soveraignty over a great part of the <hi>Known World,</hi> and exerciſed his power with ſo extravagant a cruelty, was yet upon every flaſh of Lightning and clap of Thunder awakened to a ſenſe and fearful apprehenſion of the power and juſtice of that God, whom at other times he was wont to defie. But not to dwell upon a ſingle inſtance, a further evidence that theſe Fears are the effects of Nature, may be gathered from hence, that the ſting of conſcience is moſt remarkable in thoſe actions, which are done in ſecret
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42893:109"/>
and far removed from the knowledge of men. For though we ſeek the darkeſt retirements, where no mortal eye can trace our ſteps, or behold our doings, yet there our conſcience is as a thouſand Witneſſes, continually upbraiding us with what we have done, and afflicting us with terrours, which can proceed from nothing elſe but from a ſecret conviction of ſoul that there is a God, whoſe power and knowledge reaches to all places, even to our moſt ſecret retirements, and who will one day bring upon us puniſhments proportionable to our deſervings. I will not inſiſt longer upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to take notice that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſeems to urge it to this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> ij. 14. when ſpeaking of the Gentiles to whom God had made no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revelation of his will as he had to the Jews, yet notwithſtanding he tells us, that they alſo ſhould be judged as others were; inaſmuch as they had the law of conſcience written in their hearts, and had from thence ſufficient reaſon to expect that God would call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the violation of it, and reward thoſe who did obey it. <hi>The Gentiles, which have not the law, are a law unto them-</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:42893:110"/>
               <hi>ſelves, and ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean time accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another, in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides the dictates and teſtimony of our own mind, if we conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God and his Attributes, together with our neceſſary dependance on him, this will give us further aſſurance that there is a further judgment to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. God, who gave us our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doth continually preſerve and ſupport us in it, who hath endued us with ſo many excellent perfections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Creatures, hath certainly the juſteſt right to our obedience and ſervice. And accordingly he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Laws to Mankind for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives, Laws agreeable to his own nature, Laws that are holy, and juſt, and good; and that none ſhould plead ignorance of theſe Laws, he hath as was obſerved, written them in their ſouls, and ſtampt upon them ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their divine authority and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. And can we think the All-wiſe Creator hath done all this in vain? Can
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42893:110"/>
we perſuade our ſelves that theſe divine impreſſions upon our ſoul, theſe notices of the will of God were implanted in our nature to no purpoſe at all? No ſurely, the natural promulgation of the divine Laws is alone ſufficient evidence that he expects and requires obedience to them; and that according to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance or neglect of them, he will one day either reward or puniſh us. One of the firſt and moſt natural notions of God is, that he is a rewarder of the good and vertuous. And this belief S. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as antecedent to all religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of him. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe, that he is a rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And if we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him a rewarder of the good, we muſt upon the ſame ground of Reaſon believe, that he is alſo a puniſher of the bad. Now if we look abroad into the World, it is eaſie to obſerve, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of humane affairs in this life, hath very little appearance of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and impartial Juſtice, which we have reaſon to believe God will exerciſe towards the Sons of men. It is very plain, that many men ſuffer in this World for their vertue and integrity; and that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42893:111"/>
others to the contrary, raiſe themſelves to a great degree of proſperity by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and oppreſſion. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee ſome men proſper in their Villany, others afflicted for their Piety, what can we conclude, but that the Judge of all the Earth hath appointed another time and place wherein he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and recompenſe all men according to their deſerving? It is true indeed, God doth many times in this life exert his power in the puniſhment of ſome notorious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies. There are many remarkable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions which happen in the World, which carry with them very ſignal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a divine Providence and Power preſiding over humane affairs. But the inſtances of this kind, are very few in compariſon with the great wickedneſs of Mankind: and therefore we are not to look upon the judgments that befal men in this life, as the compleat execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine Vengeance; onely that they are ſo many remembrancers to awaken men into a ſenſe of that juſtice, which will one day equally appear to all. God is pleaſed many times to make his power known in the exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42893:111"/>
of ſome men in this life, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for their own amendment that they may eſcape the Wrath to come; ſometimes for examples to others, that they may ſee it and fear, and remember that the MOST HIGH ruleth among the children of men; but ſtill the full exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his juſtice is reſerved to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life: and there we muſt expect that he will bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or bad.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A further evidence of a Judgment to come may be taken from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent teſtimony and belief of all Nations. The many Religions of the Heathen, though diſagreeing infinitely in other things, yet do all conſent in this belief, that there is another ſtate after this, when all men ſhall be rewarded or puniſhed as they have done in this. Hence aroſe the many Fables of their Poets concerning the puniſhment men underwent in Hell, and their deſcriptions of <hi>Elyzium,</hi> which they ſuppoſed to be the ſeat of happy ſouls, who had lived here holy and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Hence it was that thoſe good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who were conſcious to themſelves of having lived up to the light they had,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42893:112"/>
were ſo undaunted and couragious at the approach of death, being firmly perſuaded that their ſouls ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live their bodies, and that they ſhould enjoy the preſence of God, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of good and vertuous men that had gone before them. Thus <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught his Scholars, that if they lived ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly here, when they came to leave the body they ſhould go to Heaven, and become like God, and ſhould be no more liable to death. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid of himſelf when he was going to die, that he ſhould go to a juſt God, and to men better than any living; and that after death it was much better with good men than with the bad. Many expreſſions to this purpoſe may be gathered from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ancient Heathens, which are ſufficient intimation of this belief, that there were rewards and puniſhments to be expected in another life, according to our actions whether good or bad. Now that this belief and expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate ſhould be thus firmly received by all the ſeveral Parties in Religion, by men of all Nations and Sects, though they diſagreed infinitely in other things, muſt be grounded upon ſome certain
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42893:112"/>
Principles of Reaſon which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men, or elſe muſt be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome early revelation made by God in the beginning, before the ſeveral Nations were diſperſed over the Earth. Which of theſe may be the true account of this univerſal conſent in this matter, it is not eaſie to determine; but which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, the inference will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is a Judgment to come, becauſe all Nations have agreed in the expectation of it. For if they agreed in this Perſuaſion from the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles, there can be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence of the truth of any rational deduction, than that all men that uſe their reaſon ſhould argue alike, and agree in the ſame concluſion; and could ſuch an Argumentation deceive, we could have little encouragement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing upon the teſtimony of our Faculties.</p>
            <p>Again, If this were the effect of ſome early revelation made to men when they were yet few in number, and retained in the diſperſion of Nations, and ſtill preſerved, notwithſtanding the groſs ignorance they fell into, as to other matters. This muſt be a great evidence
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42893:113"/>
of the clearneſs and evidence of that revelation at firſt, and muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much confirm us in the belief of it. And indeed it is not improbable that the rational Evidences of this Truth of a Judgment to come, might have been confirmed to the firſt Ages of the World by ſome divine revelations, which were communicated to all, and thence derived and propagated through all the ſeveral Religions and Superſtitions which afterward were entertained by the Heathen World.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but that <hi>Noah</hi> underſtood this Truth, and would not fail to inſtruct his Family, which were all humane ſouls that were left alive, in ſo neceſſary a matter which might have ſo great influence upon them to keep them in obedience to God, who had ſo lately delivered them from ſo univerſal a deſtruction. Nay, there is ſtill extant the remainder of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy concerning a Judgment to come much ancienter than the Flood. This we find cited by Saint <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeventh from Adam propheſied, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints to execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:42893:113"/>
               <hi>upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this leads me to the laſt and moſt undeniable evidence of this truth,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The particular revelation of it in holy Scripture; but the teſtimonies of this Truth, that there is a Judgment to come, are ſo frequent in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, that it were altogether needleſs to recite them to you. Every one that hath heard of the Goſpel, muſt underſtand that is one chief Article of our Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Nothing more plainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nothing more frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than that <hi>we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to the ſecond thing propoſed, The Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding at that day, <hi>Every one ſhall receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the good or evil of mens actions in this life, is the rule and meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they ſhall be judged at the great day; that they who have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42893:114"/>
done good, ſhall receive the good they have done; and they who have done evil, ſhall receive according to that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; is a Truth ſo fully and plainly taught in holy Scripture, that one would think men could not eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or deceive themſelves in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is very plain, that no other way of proceeding can be agreeable to the Purity and Juſtice of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>The righteous God loveth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his countenance will behold the the thing that is juſt;</hi> and he is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous therefore, and they onely can be capable of reward from him, when he cometh to judge the Earth: and the wicked and unrighteous, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be the objects of his wrath and vengeance. To do otherwiſe than ſo, and to invert this method, would be a contradiction to all the divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and to all the Methods where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath made himſelf known to the Sons of men. And therefore the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſaith thus to the Almighty, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> xij. 15. <hi>For as much as thou art righteous thy ſelf,</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:42893:114"/>
               <hi>thou ordereſt all things righteouſly, thinking it not agreeable to thy power to condemn him who hath not deſerved to be puniſhed.</hi> To which we may alſo add, That it is not agreeable to his Purity and Juſtice, to reward the unrighteous and diſobedient.</p>
            <p>And therefore we may obſerve, That in all the methods of Gods dealings with the Sons of men, he hath all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the greateſt abhorrence of ſin and wickedneſs, and the greateſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt thoſe that continued in the commiſſion of it. It was Sin onely that brought Miſery and Death into the World. <hi>For by one mans diſobedience ſin entered into the World, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> And when God was pleaſed out of his infinite mercy and compaſſion to contrive the way of our recovery, and to ſend his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World for our Redemption, he would not admit us to terms of Peace and Reconciliation without the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt demonſtration of his juſtice and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt ſin; and that in the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his onely begotten Son. <hi>For he was made ſin for us, who know no ſin; he bore our griefs and carried our</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:42893:115"/>
               <hi>ſorrows; he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Now we are not to perſuade our ſelves that our Saviours ſufferings in our ſtead can be available to us, or free us from the puniſhment of our ſins, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them. For <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, for no other end, but that we being dead to ſin might live unto righteouſneſs;</hi> that ſo being ſaved from our ſins here, we might be ſaved from the Wages of them hereafter. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the <hi>grace of God hath appeared to all men to bring ſalvation,</hi> no otherwiſe than by <hi>teaching us to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live righteouſly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> Thus if we conſider the nature of God, and his dealings with Mankind, we cannot but expect, that when he cometh to judge the World, he will judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to righteouſneſs: They who have done good ſhall be rewarded by him, and they who have done evil ſhall receive a due recompence of their evil deeds.</p>
            <p n="1">2. This is further evident from the ſeveral promiſes and threatnings in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42893:115"/>
which are all along made uſe of as Arguments to perſuade us to the practice of righteouſneſs and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and to diſcourage and diſſuade us from ſin and wickedneſs; which it were in vain to do, if the promiſes of the Goſpel can be due to any but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of their obedience; or if the Wrath to come could be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any otherwiſe than by forſaking thoſe ſins to which it is threatned. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> argues from the promiſes of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vij. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Thus again S. <hi>Peter</hi> i. 4. tells, That by the Goſpel there are given unto us great and pretious promiſes, that by theſe <hi>ye may be partakers of the Divine Nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through Luſt,</hi> and beſides this, <hi>giving all diligence, add to your Faith, Vertue; and to Vertue, Knowledge; and to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Patience; and to Patience, Godlineſs; and to Godlineſs, Brotherly Kindneſs; and to Brotherly Kindneſs, Charity. For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42893:116"/>
               <hi>effectually into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now theſe and the like Exhortations would be of no force at all to perſuade us, if theſe promiſes could be attained without the performance of theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>In a word, in all the deſcriptions of a Judgment to come, there is nothing plainer than this that I now plead for; that God will reward every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he hath done. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but two places more. <hi>Rom.</hi> ij. 6. <hi>God will render to every man according to his deeds; to them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentiles: For there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</hi> The other place is <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. where our Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given us a large deſcription of thoſe good Works which ſhall then be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and having there repreſented the vanity of thoſe mens excuſes who had not wrought them, he concludes with this ſentence, <hi>theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:42893:116"/>
               <hi>puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remains onely to draw ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from what hath been ſaid, that may be of uſe to us for the government of our lives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be a Judgment to come, wherein men ſhall receive rewards and puniſhments according to their actions, whether good or bad; it is eaſie then to underſtand how much thoſe men deceive themſelves, who hope to be ſaved by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any abſolute and inconditionate decree. For if God have from eternity fore-ordained ſuch and ſuch particular perſons to eternal life, and others to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their actions, whether good or bad, then certainly God cannot proceed in judgment according to the method before deſcribed, nor could the promiſes and threatnings of the Goſpel have any force of perſuaſion to engage men in the practice of Vertue, or to diſcourage them from Sin and Wickedneſs. In vain would the Apoſtle here make uſe of the terrours of the Lord to perſuade men, if God have before determined, that ſuch a certain number of them ſhall not eſcape the wrath to come, whatſoever diligence they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42893:117"/>
uſe on their parts. On the contrary, the promiſes of the Goſpel cannot have any reaſonable force to engage men to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if once they knew and believed that their future ſtate was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unalterably fixed, ſo that they could not fall ſhort of it by any neglect. Nay, upon this ſuppoſition all the various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of perſuaſion, which God uſes in Scripture to bring men to repentance and a better life, prove nothing elſe but illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and hypocriſie. For that God ſhould ſo often by his holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles invite and exhort and beſeech all men, that they would turn from their evil ways and live, when in the mean time he hath excluded many myriads of men from any poſſibility of ſalvation by an abſolute and irreſiſtible decree, which no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of theirs can revoke or cancel; this way of proceeding cannot by any means conſiſt with that truth and ſincerity, and goodneſs, which is inſeparable from the divine nature. We muſt therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if there be a Judgment to come, when all men ſhall receive rewards and puniſhments according to what they have done, then certainly no man ſhall ever be excluded from thoſe rewards but
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42893:117"/>
by his own fault; nor yet any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame, but by a due diligence in working out his ſalvation, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe conditions upon which they are promiſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what hath been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the method of Gods proceeding at the Judgment of the laſt Day, we may alſo obſerve that thoſe men do extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the conditions of ſalvation, who talk of being ſaved by Faith, as it is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from good works and obedience; who take ſo much pains to cry down the value of our good works, as though they had little or no influence in the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſalvation of a Chriſtian. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we ſhall be judged according to what we have done, Faith alone cannot be the whole condition required on our parts in order to our ſalvation. It is true indeed, glorious things are ſpoken of Faith in holy Scripture, but theſe things muſt not be underſtood of a bare aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel, which is the proper importance of that word <hi>Faith;</hi> but of ſuch a Faith as is a principle of life and action, ſuch a Faith as hath influence upon the whole courſe of our lives, and is not contradicted by our practice and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42893:118"/>
a Faith that worketh by love and is fruitful of good works and obedience. Thus it is not to be conſidered as a ſingle Vertue and ſeparate from the reſt, but as being the fruitful parent of all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues, and including them in it. For if we underſtand Faith in a more ſtrict ſenſe, as diſtinct from an holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is no more than the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may pretend to; and yet this is ſo far from being any relief to them, that it is the great aggravation of their miſery. To know and be aſſured of the glorious things revealed in the Goſpel, and to know withal that they themſelves are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally excluded from the benefit of them; this doubtleſs is a mighty aggravation of their horrour, and we may well conclude as S. <hi>James</hi> doth, that they <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> nay that this belief doth make them tremble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we ſhall be judged according to what we have done in the body, it then follows, that all that is to be done by us in the great work of our Salvation, muſt be performed in our life time, whileſt we are in the body. Now muſt we give all diligence to make our calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure, and not leave any thing to be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42893:118"/>
done after our death, either by our ſelves or others. This I obſerve in oppoſition to that Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſuppoſes that ſome ſins are expiated after death, and purged away by the fire of Purgatory, and by the Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of thoſe that are left alive. But this is not onely a vain and groundleſs opinion, but certainly doth much tend to the hindrance of Piety, and leſſening mens care of their future ſtate. As the Tree falleth ſo it lieth. As a man goeth out of this World, ſuch will be his future ſtate; and he will be judged according to what he was when he left the body, according to what he had done in the body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it be thus certain that we muſt all appear before the Judgment ſeat of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that every one may receive the things done in his body, this certainly ought to awaken our diligence in the buſineſs of our Salvation; that to day, while it is called to day, we break off our ſins by a ſincere and hearty repentance; that knowing the terrours of the Lord, we paſs the time of our ſo journing here in fear. For ſurely did men ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there is a day coming, when all
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42893:119"/>
the hidden works of darkneſs ſhall be made manifeſt, when the ſecrets of all mens hearts ſhall be revealed, when all the cloſe impieties which had paſſed here undiſcerned, ſhould be laid open before God and all the World; they would not now ſo fondly flatter themſelves with hopes of ſecreſie or impunity. Did men ſeriouſly reflect upon the terribleneſs of that great day. when God ſhall appear with ten thouſand of his Saints to take vengeance on them that have not feared his name, did they often think upon that dreadful ſentence which will then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt all impenitent ſinners, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> this certainly, if any thing, would put a check to the bold impiety of this Age. Men would not then dare ſo openly to defie Heaven, and blaſpheme the Majeſty of the great God, who will at that day appear ſo terrible, nor would they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue by their hardneſs and impenitent hearts, to treaſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, as the terrours of that day ought to make us ſenſible of our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42893:119"/>
if we continue in diſobedience, ſo the glorious reward which ſhall at that day be given to thoſe that have lived obediently to the will of God, ought to be a moſt effectual motive to perſuade us thereunto. For what greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our duty, than the conſideration of thoſe great and glorious things which God hath prepared for them that love him? Who would not willingly forſake all the flattering joys and tranſitory plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life, that he may ſecure to himſelf ſuch an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, which God the righteous Judge ſhall give him at that day? Or who would not deſpiſe all the ſufferings of this life, which may poſſibly attend him in the practice of his duty, when he remembers that theſe light afflictions, which endure but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, work out for him a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory?</p>
            <p>Now the great God grant us all his grace, that we may have the judgment of the laſt day always preſent to our minds, that denying all ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, we may live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope and glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42893:120"/>
of the great God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt: that when we come to ſtand before that great Tribunal, we may be preſented pure and unblamable in his ſight; and that not for any merits of our own, but through the mediation of our bleſſed Saviour: To whom, with the Father, and Eternal Spirit be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as is moſt due, all power, praiſe, thankſgiving, and obedience, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
